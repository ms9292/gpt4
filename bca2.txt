BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding functional outcomes after robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) and intracorporeal neobladder (ICNB) reconstruction.
OBJECTIVE: To report on urinary continence (UC) and erectile function (EF) at 12 
mo after RARC and ICNB reconstruction and investigate predictors of these 
outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from a multi-institutional 
database of patients who underwent RARC and ICNB reconstruction for bladder 
cancer.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: The cystoprostatectomy sensu stricto followed the 
conventional steps. ICNB reconstruction was performed at the physician's 
discretion according to the Studer/Wiklund, S pouch, Gaston, vescica ileale 
Padovana, or Hautmann technique. The techniques are detailed in the video 
accompanying the article.
MEASUREMENTS: The outcomes measured were UC and EF at 12 mo.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 732 male patients were identified with a 
median age at diagnosis of 64 yr (interquartile range 58-70). The ICNB 
reconstruction technique was Studer/Wiklund in 74%, S pouch in 1.5%, Gaston in 
19%, vescica ileale Padovana in 1.5%, and Hautmann in 4% of cases. The 12-mo UC 
rate was 86% for daytime and 66% for nighttime continence, including patients 
who reported the use of a safety pad (20% and 32%, respectively). The 12-mo EF 
rate was 55%, including men who reported potency with the aid of 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (24%). After adjusting for potential 
confounders, neobladder type was not associated with UC. Unilateral 
nerve-sparing (odds ratio [OR] 3.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.88-7.85; 
p < 0.001) and bilateral nerve-sparing (OR 6.25, 95% CI 3.55-11.0; p < 0.001), 
were positively associated with EF, whereas age (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95; 
p < 0.001) and an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 (OR 0.46, 95% 
CI 0.25-0.89; p < 0.02) were inversely associated with EF.
CONCLUSIONS: RARC and ICNB reconstruction are generally associated with good 
functional outcomes in terms of UC. EF is highly affected by the degree of nerve 
preservation, age, and comorbidities.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated functional outcomes after robot-assisted 
removal of the bladder in terms of urinary continence and erectile function. We 
found that, in general, patients have relatively good functional outcomes at 12 
months after surgery.

BACKGROUND: Head-to-head comparisons between ileal conduit (IC) and orthotopic 
neobladder (ONB) in terms of peri- and postoperative outcomes and complications, 
in the specific setting of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC), are not 
available.
OBJECTIVE: To address the impact of the type of urinary diversion (UD, IC vs 
ONB) on RARC morbidity, as well as operative time (OT), length of stay (LOS), 
and readmissions.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Urothelial bladder cancer patients treated with 
RARC at nine high-volume European institutions between 2008 and 2020 were 
identified.
INTERVENTION: RARC with either IC or ONB.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Intra- and postoperative 
complications were collected and reported according to the Intraoperative 
Complications Assessment and Reporting with Universal Standards recommendations 
and European Association of Urology guidelines, respectively. Multivariable 
logistic regression models tested the impact of UD on outcomes, after adjustment 
for clustering at single hospital level.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 555 nonmetastatic RARC patients were 
identified. In 280 (51%) and 275 (49%) patients, an IC and an ONB were 
performed, respectively. Eighteen intraoperative complications were recorded. 
The rates of intraoperative complications were 4% in IC patients and 3% in ONB 
patients (p = 0.4). The median LOS and readmission rates were 10 versus 12 d 
(p < 0.001) and 20% versus 21% (p = 0.8) in IC versus ONB patients, 
respectively. At a multivariable logistic regression analyses, the type of UD 
(IC vs ONB) reached the independent predictor status for prolonged OT (odds 
ratio [OR]: 0.61, p = 0.03) and prolonged LOS (OR: 0.34, p < 0.001), but not for 
readmission (OR: 0.92, p = 0.7). Overall, 513 postoperative complications were 
experienced by 324 patients (58%). At least one postoperative complication was 
experienced by 160 (57%) IC patients versus 164 (60%) ONB patients (p = 0.6). 
The type of UD reached the status of an independent predictor of UD-related 
complications (OR: 0.64, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with RARC with ONB, RARC with IC is less prone to 
UD-related postoperative complications, prolonged OT, and prolonged LOS.
PATIENT SUMMARY: To date, the impact of the type of urinary diversion, namely, 
ileal conduit versus orthotopic neobladder, on peri- and postoperative outcomes 
of robot-assisted radical cystectomy is unknown. Based on a rigorous data 
accrual, which relied on established complication reporting systems 
(Intraoperative Complications Assessment and Reporting with Universal Standards 
and European Association of Urology recommended systems), we reported intra- and 
postoperative complications according to urinary diversion type. Moreover, we 
found that ileal conduit was associated with lower operative time and length of 
stay, and yielded a protective effect in terms of urinary diversion-related 
complications.

CT Evaluation of the Findings of Nutcracker Syndrome in Patients with Bladder 
Cancer after Radical Cystectomy and Ileal Neobladder Formation: A Correlation 
with Hematuria.

Shin HM, Lee J, Lee DH, Kim SH.

PURPOSE: Patients with bladder cancer may show hematuria after radical 
cystectomy with ileal neobladder formation, causing anxiety regarding tumor 
recurrence. Here, we aim to show that the nutcracker syndrome (NCS) can be a 
cause of hematuria post-operation, and is a common, rather than a rare syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of contrast-enhanced 
abdominopelvic CT (CE-APCT) and urine analysis (UA) findings of 255 patients 
with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder 
formation between 2011 and 2016 was performed. In the CE-APCT review, the left 
renal vein flow patterns were evaluated to determine the presence of NCS 
findings. In the UA review, patients were classified according to the percentage 
of UA tests with positive hematuria among the total number of UA tests.
RESULTS: CT findings of NCS were present in 31.9% of the 135 patients. In the 
positive hematuria group, there were 26% more patients with NCS findings than 
those without.
CONCLUSION: NCS findings are prevalent even for bladder cancer patients after 
surgery, and there is a strong correlation between NCS findings and hematuria. 
Furthermore, the prevalence of NCS findings is much higher than urinary tract 
recurrence after the surgery.

대한 불안을 유발할 수 있다. 그러나 종양 재발뿐 아니라 호두까기 증후군이 수술 후 혈뇨의 원인이 될 수 있으며, 이는 빈번한 증후군일 수 
있음을 증명하려고 한다.
대상과 방법: 2011년부터 2016년까지 근치적방광적출 후 회장 신방광형성술을 시행 받은 255명의 방광암 환자를 대상으로 조영증강 복부골반 
컴퓨터단층촬영과 소변검사 소견을 후향적으로 분석하였다. 컴퓨터단층촬영에서 호두까기 증후군 소견의 유무는 좌신정맥 흐름 패턴을 평가하여 
판단하였다. 소변분석에서는 총 소변검사에서 혈뇨가 양성인 비율에 따라 환자를 분류하였다.
결과: 컴퓨터단층촬영에서 호두까기 증후군 소견은 135명의 환자 중 31.9%에서 나타났다. 혈뇨 양성 그룹에서는 호두까기 증후군의 소견이 없는 
환자보다 있는 환자가 26% 더 많았다.
결론: 호두까기 증후군의 소견은 수술 후 방광암 환자에게 빈번하였으며, 호두까기 증후군 소견과 혈뇨 사이에는 유의미한 상관관계가 있었다. 또한 
호두까기 증후군 소견의 유병률은 수술 후 요로의 종양 재발률보다 높았다.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize some key steps of functional improvement in robotic 
intracorporeal studer's orthotopic neobladder (RISON) of males, especially for 
nerve-spring technique. We also presented the result of 1-year follow-up aimed 
to illustrate its functional trifecta outcomes.
METHODS: Robotic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal studer's orthotopic 
neobladder was performed on 33 male patients by the same surgeon from April 2018 
to March 2019. Nerve-sparing technique had been used in 11 of the 33 patients. A 
prospectively maintained dataset was retrospectively searched and the related 
perioperative and follow-up data were analyzed. The functional trifecta outcomes 
referred to the freedom from recurrence, urinary continence and sexual function 
recovery after one year.
RESULTS: A total of 33 males were included in our study. All perioperative 
information was recorded in detail. Thirty-two cases were confirmed to have 
negative surgical margin, except one pT3a case. And another case of incidental 
prostate cancer was diagnosed pathologically. All patients (100%) were 
recurrence-free one year after the operation. Eleven patients underwent 
nerve-sparing surgeries, including inter-fascial techniques or intra-fascial 
techniques. All these patients attained daytime continence (0 pad) at 1 month. 
With the nighttime continence, nerve-sparing group (2, 2,1) used fewer pads than 
other 22 cases (3, 3,2) at 1, 6 or 12 month(s) respectively. We defined urinary 
continence as 0 pad in daytime and no more than 1 pad in nighttime. The median 
preoperative score of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) in the 
11 cases was 24. The sexual function recovery was defined as IIEF-6 > 20. The 
final trifecta rate was 54.5% and the median follow-up time lasted 17 months 
(range, 12 to 22 months).
CONCLUSIONS: RISON could be a safe and feasible choice of urinary diversion. 
Nerve sparing techniques might help the patients achieve a relatively higher 
functional trifecta rate.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies on robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) 
have shown that preservation of the anterior periprostatic structures is 
associated with good functional outcomes in terms of urinary continence and 
erectile function. With this in mind, we developed a technique for preservation 
of the lower part of the detrusor apron (LDA) and anterior periprostatic 
structures at the time of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and 
intracorporeal neobladder (ICNB) reconstruction.
OBJECTIVE: To describe our LDA-sparing RARC technique and to assess its safety 
and outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively evaluated 11 patients who 
underwent LDA-sparing RARC and ICNB reconstruction at our centre from January 
2017 to May 2021.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: In brief, after developing the plane posterior to the 
bladder and prostate, the dissection proceeds laterally on both sides of the 
prostate in an effort to identify the prostatic pedicle. At this point, the 
bladder pedicles are sectioned in an antegrade fashion. Once the prostate is 
reached, the dissection is continued laterally by developing the plane that was 
previously identified. The neurovascular bundles and the lateral and anterior 
periprostatic structures are conserved in toto. Neobladder reconstruction is 
performed intracorporeally.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Postoperative complications, urinary continence (UC), and 
erectile function (EF).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median console time was 290 min. The 30-d 
complication rate was 36%, with two Clavien-Dindo grade II and two grade III 
complications that were not attributable to the novel surgical technique. At 12 
mo, all patients reported daytime UC or use of a safety pad; at night, seven 
patients were continent or used a safety pad. Regarding 12-mo EF, four patients 
were potent without a need for medications, while six were potent with the use 
of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and one with the use of 
intracavernosal injections. Limitations include the small number of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: LDA-sparing RARC is an applicable and reproducible procedure. Our 
results suggest that this approach is associated with good functional outcomes 
in terms of UC and EF.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We describe a novel approach for robot-assisted removal of the 
bladder that allows greater preservation of nerve bundles and other structures. 
Our study shows that the technique is safe and associated with good outcomes for 
urinary function and erectile function for patients eligible for this surgical 
procedure.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate whether functional screening, as 
assessed by the Geriatric-8 (G8) and the instrumental activities of daily living 
(IADL)-modified G8, are associated with the inability to manage a stoma by 
themselves in patients with bladder cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 110 consecutive patients with 
bladder cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy and were screened 
preoperatively using the G8 and the IADL-modified G8 at our institution between 
January 2020 and December 2022. Patients who could not undergo geriatric 
screening at the preoperative clinic before surgery and patients who underwent 
orthotopic neobladder construction were excluded. We evaluated the association 
between clinical factors, including scores of G8 and IADL-modified G8, and the 
inability to manage a stoma by oneself. For both G8 and IADL-modified G8, a 
cutoff value of ≤14 was set.
RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, the median age was 77 years, 92 (84%) patients 
were male and 47 (43%) patients were unable to manage a stoma by themselves. The 
geriatric assessment indicated that 64 patients (58%) were classified in the low 
G8 (≤14) group and 66 patients (60%) were classified in the low IADL-modified G8 
(≤14) group. The values of area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve for predicting inability to manage stoma by oneself were 0.725 for the G8 
and 0.734 for the IADL-modified G8, respectively. Multivariate analysis 
including the G8 revealed that age ≥ 80, Charlson comorbidity index of ≥3, and 
G8 ≤ 14 (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-13.0; 
P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for inability to manage a stoma by 
oneself. Likewise, multivariate analysis including the IADL-modified G8 revealed 
that age ≥ 80, Charlson comorbidity index of ≥3, and IADL-modified G8 ≤ 14 
(OR = 5.4; 95% CI = 1.9-14.0; P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for 
inability to manage a stoma by oneself.
DISCUSSION: Screening using G8 and IADL-modified G8 may predict patients who 
have difficulty self-managing their stomas.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To give an overview of the most relevant recent literature 
about urinary tract infections (UTI) after radical cystectomy and to discuss 
them in the context of new individualized therapy approaches and possible 
preventive measures.
RECENT FINDINGS: UTI following radical cystectomy is a common complication 
associated with significant morbidity and readmission risk. Recent literature 
focuses on the identification of risk factors and the optimization of 
management. The risk factors most commonly associated with increased risk for 
UTI were perioperative blood transfusions and orthotopic neobladder (ONB). 
Furthermore, the effect of perioperative antibiotic regimens on rates of 
postoperative infections has been studied, but no consistent significant changes 
in UTI rates have yet been identified. Guidelines should be based on urologic 
studies and, wherever appropriate, should be uniform in design to encourage more 
frequent adherence. Furthermore, understanding the pathomechanisms leading to 
the development of UTI after radical cystectomy needs to be more central to 
discussions.
SUMMARY: Uniform definition of UTI, characteristics of bacterial pathogens 
involved, and type and duration of antibiotics used and identification of 
clinical risk factors must be the focus of well designed prospective studies to 
enable reduction of the most common complication after radical cystectomy.

PURPOSE: Functional outcomes of robot-assisted (RA) radical cystectomy (RC) with 
intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder (i-ON) have been poorly investigated. The 
study aimed to report functional outcomes of a prospective randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) comparing open RC (ORC) and RARC with i-ON.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria were cT2-4/N0/M0, or BCG-failure high-grade 
urothelial carcinoma, candidate to RC with curative intent. A covariate adaptive 
randomization process was used, based on the following variables: BMI, ASA 
score, haemoglobin levels, cT-stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, urinary 
diversion. Day-time continence was defined as "totally dryness", nigh-time 
continence as pad wetness ≤ 50 cc. Continence recovery probabilities were 
compared between arms with Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis was 
performed to identify predictors of continence recovery. HRQoL outcomes analysis 
was assessed with a generalized linear mixed effect regression (GLMER) model.
RESULTS: Out of 116 patients randomized, 88 received ON. Quantitative analysis 
of functional outcomes reported similar results in terms of day continence, 
while a better night continence status in ORC cohort was observed. However, 
1-yr day- and night-time continence recovery probabilities were comparable. 
Night-time micturition frequency < 3 h was the only predictor of nigh-time 
continence recovery. At GLMER, 1-yr body image and sexual functioning were 
significantly better in RARC cohort, while urinary symptoms were comparable 
between arms.
CONCLUSION: Despite superiority of ORC at quantitative night-time pad use 
analysis, we showed comparable day- and night-time continence recovery 
probabilities. At 1-yr analysis of HRQoL outcomes, urinary symptoms were 
comparable between arms, while RARC patients reported lower body image and 
sexual functioning worsening.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive disease for which the 
gold-standard treatment is radical cystectomy (RC) in combination with 
cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Bladder-sparing strategies such as 
trimodal therapy (TMT) have also emerged to improve health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) of patients. However, an improved understanding of the effect of 
all these treatment modalities on HRQoL is essential to provide personalized 
patient care. Different combinations of generic, cancer-specific and bladder 
cancer-specific questionnaires can be used as instruments for HRQoL evaluation 
in patients with MIBC before and after curative treatments, which can largely 
affect multiple domains of HRQoL including general health as well as physical, 
functional, social and emotional well-being. However, diagnosis of MIBC per se 
is also likely to affect HRQoL, and the perspective of cure after RC or TMT 
could induce a return to baseline HRQoL values for most of these domains. A 
considerable amount of data on HRQoL after RC is available, but conflicting 
results have been reported regarding the effect of urinary diversion (ileal 
conduit or orthotopic neobladder) and surgical approach (open or robotic 
surgery) on patient quality of life. Data on HRQoL after TMT are scarce, and 
additional comparative studies including patients receiving RC (especially using 
ileal orthotopic neobladder) are needed.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of CellDetect, a new biomarker with urine 
cytology and UroVysiontechnology for bladder cancer detection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an IRB approved prospective, blinded single 
center study in patients on routine surveillance for nonmuscle invasive bladder 
cancer and those scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumor or 
radical cystectomy. Patients with bladder catheters, neobladder, ileal conduit, 
urinary stones, or those with upper tract carcinoma were excluded from the 
study. Voided urine sample was collected from the participants and each sample 
was divided into three equal aliquots (CellDetect, Urine cytology and 
Urovysion). Pathology of the operative specimen was considered the gold standard 
to which the three markers were compared.
RESULTS: The study group included 93 patients with median age was 68 years 
(range: 34-92 years) with male to female ratio of 12:1. Pathologic evaluation 
revealed malignancy in 43 cases (46%) of whom 81% had previous history of 
urothelial bladder cancer. Among all studied markers CellDetect exhibited the 
best performance followed by urine cytology and U-FISH with diagnostic odds 
ratio of 4.33, 3.85, and 2.5 respectively. The overall sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for this test were 84%, 
80%, 88%, and 74% respectively. The advantage of this new biomarker was observed 
both in high grade and low-grade cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the advantage of CellDetect as a 
urine-based assay to detect urothelial bladder cancer over urine cytology and 
U-FISH test. The high performance was maintained across all cancer grades and 
stages without compromising the assay specificity. Additional studies are 
required to test if it can be a noninvasive alternative to cystoscopy.

BACKGROUND: Benign uretero-ileal anastomotic stricture (UIAS) is a major 
complication following radical cystectomy (RC) and ileal orthotopic bladder 
substitution, and it can occur in combination with other complications. But risk 
factors for patients with UIAS have not been well described.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 198 patients treated with RC 
for bladder cancer from 2014 to 2019 at the Zhejiang Provincial People's 
Hospital. Patient demographic and clinical variables were examined to determine 
the risk factors associated with UIAS by univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 180 patients into the group standards and in all 360 
uretero-ileal anastomoses. Among the above cases, 22 patients developed UIAS, 
including 10 cases of left UIAS, nine cases of right UIAS, and three cases of 
bilateral UIAS. There was no difference in demographic, operative, or 
perioperative variables between patients with and without UIAS. In a 
multivariate analysis, after adjusting for gender, age, surgical methods, and 
underlying diseases, intraoperative or postoperative blood transfusion (HR = 
0.144, P <0.01), postoperative urinary tract infection (HR = 3.624, P <0.01), 
and extracorporeal bladder anastomosis (HR = 3.395, P = 0.02) significantly 
increased the risk of UIAS.
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, intraoperative or postoperative blood 
transfusion, postoperative urinary tract infection, and extracorporeal 
neobladder anastomoses increased the risk of UIAS after radical cystectomy and 
ileal orthotopic bladder substitution surgery. Further studies with larger 
samples are necessary to validate this result.

BACKGROUND: The intracorporeal orthotopic modified-Y "Bordeaux" neobladder 
(iYNB) was first described in 2016. No urodynamic evaluation of this neobladder 
has yet been performed.
OBJECTIVE: To present the urodynamic features of the iYNB and 
incontinence-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We prospectively assessed 26 patients operated 
between September 2018 and November 2020.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Robotic radical cystectomy for malignant disease of the 
bladder and iYNB, performed by a single surgeon, were used.
MEASUREMENTS: Three months after surgery and in November 2021, consenting 
patients underwent clinical evaluation and multichannel urodynamic study (UDS). 
The incontinence quality of life (I-QoL) questionnaire was used to evaluate 
HRQoL. Continence was classified into day- and nighttime, and clinically defined 
as the use of zero pads. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The mean age at surgery was 65.4 yr. The mean follow-up 
period was 27 mo (12-38). The mean time for the neobladder reconstruction was 
192 min (110-340). The mean maximum capacity was 431 cm3 (range 200-553). The 
mean postvoid residual was 101.6 ml (0-310), and the rate of clean intermittent 
catheterization was 17.6%. With the exception of a significant reduction in the 
volume of the first sensation of bladder fullness, no other statistically 
significant changes in the UDS parameters of both the storage and the voiding 
phase were observed over time. Day- and nighttime continence rates were 58.8% 
and 23.5%, respectively. The mean postoperative I-QoL score was 103.3 (89-110). 
Limitations include the small number of patients and short follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The UDS evaluation of iYNB demonstrates that both the volumetric 
and the pressure characteristics are acceptable and may enhance quality of life. 
Prospective studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up are 
needed to further evaluate the iYNB.
PATIENT SUMMARY: The "Bordeaux" neobladder provides acceptable urodynamic 
outcomes. It is associated with high levels of health-related quality of life 
and good rates of continence in patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of the avatera system for performing 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) followed by intracorporeal 
reconstruction of ileal neobladder.
METHODS: Six anesthetized female pigs were used to perform RARC and formation of 
the intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder. Three surgeons with different 
level of expertise in the use of robotic systems performed RARC after a short 
instructional lecture and a 2-h hands-on training. The urinary diversion phase 
was performed only by the experienced surgeon. The successful completion of the 
procedure, operative time for demolitive and reconstructive phases, 
intraoperative blood loss and malfunction of the robotic system were evaluated.
RESULTS: An improvement of the operative time was observed for each surgeon. The 
experienced surgeon, the fellow and the resident improved their time by 11, 15, 
and 22 min, respectively, between the first and the second RARC performed. The 
most significant time difference was demonstrated by the resident, who had no 
previous experience in using robotic systems. The time difference between the 
first and the last orthotopic ileal neobladder creation for the experienced 
surgeon was 51 min.
CONCLUSION: The feasibility of avatera system for performing complex surgical 
procedure such as RARC with intracorporeal neobladder formation was demonstrated 
by this experimental study. No major bleeding or severe malfunctions were 
observed during the procedures. Significant improvement in operative time was 
demonstrated with the increasing experience from 1st to 6th case.

To maintain a surgeon's concentration, reduce fatigue, and train young surgeons, 
surgical procedures for bladder cancer are divided into the following parts: 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC), bowel reconstruction, and totally 
intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) (RARC+ICUD). Each part is performed by a 
different surgeon (Trisection method). We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy 
and safety of this approach at a single institution in Japan. One hundred 
consecutive patients who underwent RARC+ICUD at Gifu University Hospital between 
November 2018 and August 2022 were included in this study. The patient 
background, surgical outcomes, and postoperative complications were compared 
between surgeries by first-, second-, and third-generation surgeons. The overall 
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between surgeries 
by each generation. Of the 100 patients, 19, 38, and 43 RARCs were performed by 
first-, second-, and third-generation surgeons, respectively. There were 35, 25, 
and 39 patients who underwent ileal conduit, neobladder, and 
ureterocutaneostomy, respectively. No significant differences were found among 
the patients respective to the type of ICUDs. Although the first-generation 
surgeon had a significantly shorter operative time with RARC, the surgical time 
for bowel reconstruction, length of hospital stays, and incidence of 
postoperative complications were not significantly different among the groups. 
Additionally, OS and RFS did not differ significantly among the generations. The 
"Trisection method" is an effective and safe concept with no difference in 
outcomes between the generations of surgeons.

The Body Image Scale (BIS) is a 10-item tool that measures the body images of 
cancer patients. This study aims to validate the Japanese version of the BIS for 
bladder cancer patients. A multicenter cross-sectional survey was used to 
identify the participants, which included Japanese bladder cancer patients. The 
percentage of missing responses, internal consistency, and known-group validity 
were evaluated. The correlations between the BIS and two HRQOL instruments (the 
Bladder Cancer Index and the SF-12) were assessed to determine convergent 
validity. Among 397 patients, 221 patients were treated by transurethral 
resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) endoscopically, 49 patients underwent 
cystectomy with neobladder, and 127 patients underwent cystectomy involving 
stoma. The percentage of missing responses in the BIS ranged from 8.1 to 15.6%. 
Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.924. Higher BIS scores indicate negative body 
image, and the median BIS score for patients with native bladders after TURBT 
(0.5) was significantly lower than those of the patients with neobladder (4.0) 
and stoma formation (7.0), which indicated the discriminatory ability of the 
BIS. Each domain of the Bladder Cancer Index and the role summary score of the 
SF-12 correlated to the BIS scores, which confirmed the convergent validity. A 
range of BIS scores were identified among patients who reported similar physical 
summary scores and mental summary scores of the SF-12. This study confirmed the 
reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the BIS for bladder cancer 
patients.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the oncological and urinary functional outcomes of 
reproductive organ-sparing radical cystectomy (ROS-RC) and U-shaped ileal 
neobladder construction in females compared with male patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined 357 patients (281 male and 76 female) with 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer who were treated with RC plus U-shaped ileal 
neobladder construction between May 1996 and July 2021. All female patients were 
treated with ROS-RC. We compared disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific 
survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and urinary functional outcomes between 
male and female patients. We evaluated the effect of gender on DFS, CSS, and OS. 
Furthermore, urinary functional outcomes were evaluated in 140 males and 48 
females using a pressure-flow study at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Female patients were considerably older than male patients at the time 
of radical cystectomy. No significant difference was noted in the tumor stage 
preoperatively. The multivariable Cox regression analysis with an inverse 
probability treatment weighted model revealed that the female gender was not 
significantly related to DFS, CSS, and OS. Moreover, urinary functions at 12 
months were not markedly different between males and females, except for the 
capacity of the neobladder, detrusor pressure, and maximum urethral closure 
pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that female patients with ROS-RC and 
U-shaped ileal neobladder construction did not significantly correlate with 
worse oncological outcomes. The combination of ROS-RC and U-shaped ileal 
neobladder construction might attain adequate urinary function without 
sacrificing oncologic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Robotic intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction is a complex 
procedure in which the approximation of the reservoir to the urethral stump can 
be a demanding step. The aim of the study is to evaluate the reproducibility of 
a modified posterior reconstruction (PR) during the reconfiguration of 
intracorporeal neobladder after robot assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2021 to July 2022, 35 RARC were performed, and 
17 patients underwent intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction. A PR was planned 
in males (14). Intra- and peri-operative data were collected.
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: RARC and node dissection are performed. Afterwards, 40-cm 
ileal segment is isolated; the portion with the more adequate mesenteric length 
is brought down to the pelvis. A modified PR is performed with a double-armed 
barbed suture: a first layer connects the Denonvillier's fascia to the 
rhabdosphincter in a running fashion; the second layer is created with the other 
arm and approximates the posterior side of the ileal segment towards the 
urethral stump. In the anterior caudal part of the ileum, a 1.5-cm incision is 
made to realize the neobladder neck; the neovesical-urethral anastomosis is 
performed with a second bidirectional suture.
RESULTS: Anastomotic and PR time were 14 (range 7-20) and 5 minutes (4-8), 
respectively. A single Clavien IIIa complication was recorded in a patient who 
underwent NAC and had a C. albicans superinfection in the post-operative course. 
All patients were discharged with complete or acceptable bladder voiding. Twelve 
patients with follow-up >90-days reported a satisfying daytime continence.
CONCLUSIONS: PR represents a simple technical refinement that improves 
neobladder-urethral anastomosis by favoring ileal approximation to the urethral 
stump and decreasing anastomotic tension.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Standard radical cystectomy (RC) in women includes the 
removal of the bladder, urethra, uterus with the adnexa, and the anterior 
vaginal wall, thereby severely affecting the urinary, sexual, and reproductive 
system. To limit these detrimental effects, organ-sparing, including 
nerve-sparing approaches, have been developed. Health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) and functional outcomes are, indeed, becoming increasingly central to 
the shared decision-making with the patient. The objectives of this narrative 
review are: (I) to review the current status of RC in women, including the use 
of different urinary diversions (UDs); (II) to discuss organ-sparing approaches 
and their impact on oncological and functional outcomes in women; (III) to 
discuss the impact of RC on HRQOL and sexual function in women.
METHODS: We performed a non-systematic literature review of the available 
publications in the PubMed database.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Over the past years, gender differences in oncological 
and functional outcomes after RC have received increased attention. According to 
the currently available literature, organ-sparing approaches can be safely 
performed in well-selected women without negatively impacting oncological 
outcomes. The orthotopic neobladder is feasible and oncologically safe in 
well-selected and informed women. The choice of the UD should be based on 
comprehensive counseling and the patient's comorbidities and preferences. There 
still is a lack of data on sexual recovery after the different surgical 
approaches aimed to mitigate sexual dysfunction in women undergoing RC.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-and post-operative counseling and support of females undergoing 
RC regarding their expectations and experiences in terms of quality of life and 
functional and sexual outcomes are currently insufficient. Well-designed studies 
in this field are necessary to further improve outcomes of women treated with RC 
with an overarching aim to close the gender gap in managing women with bladder 
cancer.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC) is a 
rare spectrum of congenital genitourinary malformations with an incidence of 
1:10,000 to 1:50,000. Advances in reconstructive surgical techniques have 
improved clinical outcomes, but there is a paucity in data about disease sequela 
in adulthood. This is the largest survey to date in the United States exploring 
the urinary continence, bladder management, and oncologic outcomes in adults 
with BEEC.
METHODS: Respondents were over the age of 18 with a diagnosis of bladder 
exstrophy, cloacal exstrophy, or epispadias. They were treated at the authors' 
institution, included in the Association for the Bladder Exstrophy Community 
(A-BE-C) mailing list, and/or engaged in A-BE-C social media. A survey was 
created using uniquely designed questions and questionnaires. Survey responses 
between May 2020 and July 2020 were processed using Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap). Quantitative and qualitative statistics were used to analyze 
the data with significance at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 165 patients completed the survey. The median age was 31.5 
years (IQR 25.9-45.9). Many patients considered themselves continent of urine, 
with a median satisfaction score of 74 (IQR 50-97) on a scale from 0 (consider 
themselves to be completely incontinent) to 100 (consider themselves to be 
completely continent). There was less leakage among those with a continent 
urinary diversion compared to those who void or catheterize per urethra 
(p = 0.003). Patients with intestinal-urinary tract reconstruction, such as 
augmentation cystoplasty or neobladder creation, were more likely to perform 
bladder irrigations (p = 0.03). Patients with continent channels were more 
likely to report UTI than all other forms of bladder management (89.0% vs. 
66.2%, p = 0.003). Three (1.9%) patients were diagnosed with bladder cancer. A 
small portion of patients (27.2%) were given bladder cancer surveillance 
recommendations by a physician.
DISCUSSION: Most patients achieved a satisfactory level of urinary continence, 
with the highest continence rates in those with a continent urinary diversion. 
Those with intestinal-urinary tract reconstruction were more likely to perform 
bladder irrigations, perhaps to avoid complications from intestinal mucous 
production. The rates of self-reported UTI and were higher in patients with 
continent channels, but recurrent UTIs were not affected by the type of 
genitourinary reconstruction. Bladder cancer exists in this population, 
highlighting the need for long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Most BEEC patients achieve a satisfactory level of urinary 
continence, with the best outcomes in those with a continent urinary diversion. 
This population requires long-term follow-up with a transitional urologist to 
ensure adequate oncologic care.

CONTEXT-OBJECTIVE: The management of bladder tumors is based on two major 
interventions, the risks of complications of which can be significant. The 
objective of this work is to provide an update on the complications related to 
bladder surgery, to detail the preventive measures and management strategies in 
practice.
METHODS: Bibliographic search using Medline bibliographic database (Pubmed) 
using the following keywords: transurethral resection of the bladder, 
cystectomy, neobladder, Bricker, complications, anastomotic strictures.
RESULTS: Trans-urethral resection of the bladder (TURB) essentially exposes to 
the risk of hemorrhage (2 to 4%) and bladder perforation (1 to 3%). Total 
cystectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, despite 
recent technical advances. The most frequent early complications are ileus (23 
to 30%) and infectious complications (29 to 38%). Late complications included by 
functional complications (urinary and sexual), anastomotic strictures (7 to 
12%), metabolic complications of continent derivation (25 to 46%) and stomial 
complications in case of non-continent derivation. The management of 
complications is well codified. It is however essential to anticipate and put in 
place preventive measures, especially for infectious and thromboembolic 
complications, including an exhaustive pre-operative assessment, prehabilitation 
of the patient and enhanced recovery after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Preventing, analyzing and understanding complications in bladder 
surgery is essential to reduce mortality and morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: To report the preliminary surgical outcomes for single incision 
robotic cystectomy (SIRC). Robotic cystectomy is associated with low utilization 
rates of orthotopic neobladders due to challenges related to intracorporeal 
sowing and configuration. A new technique that shortens the learning curve and 
reduces the incisional footprint may improve outcomes and lead to greater 
utilization of neobladders.
METHODS: Patients undergoing SIRC using the Da Vinci Single Port (SP) robot 
between March 2021 and March 2022 are included in this retrospective study. We 
report 30-day perioperative outcomes and test the hypothesis that patients 
undergoing SIRC have lower analgesic requirements by comparing them to a cohort 
of patients for whom SIRC was attempted but converted to open during the study 
period.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients underwent SIRC, with 17 (41%) patients undergoing 
conversion to open. Of the SIRC patients, 50% underwent orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction, and 13% underwent concomitant nephroureterectomy or 
urethrectomy. The median operative time was 480 minutes, and the median length 
of hospitalization was 7 days. Seventeen percent required readmission to the 
hospital, 17% developed small bowel obstruction or ileus, and 13% required a 
blood transfusion. With respect to analgesic requirements, there were no 
differences in the median morphine milligram equivalents between the 2 cohorts 
(SIRC: 81.4; converted: 77.0; P = .64).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that SIRC is safe and feasible with a high neobladder 
utilization rate. Wider adoption of this technique may lead to greater 
utilization of neobladders for patients undergoing robotic cystectomy.

OBJECTIVE: To present the extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy (ELRC) 
technique, and initial outcomes of organ-preserving and orthotopic neobladder 
(ONB) techniques for bladder cancer in selected females.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data including patient characteristics, operative time, 
blood loss, transfusion rate, length of hospital stay, and pathologic outcomes, 
as well as 30- and 90-day complications were collected between April 2018 and 
May 2021 from females who underwent ONB after ELRC. Regular follow-up focused on 
patients' oncological and functional outcomes, and postoperative sexual function 
status was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).
RESULTS: Eleven females with a mean age of 53 years who underwent ELRC with 
pelvic organ-preservation and ONB were analyzed retrospectively. All procedures 
were completed successfully. The mean operative time was 264.82 ± 33.81 min, and 
the average intraoperative blood loss was 128 ± 18.19 mL. All patients had 
negative pathological margins and no lymph node metastases. The average hospital 
stay was 10.72 days. The single J ureteral stent and catheter were usually 
removed 3-4 weeks after the procedure. The FIFS assessment of postoperative 
sexual function showed that the patients were relatively satisfied.
CONCLUSION: ELRC with pelvic organ preservation and ONB technology was a safe 
and feasible surgical strategy for the selected female patients. Preserving 
organs and vascular nerve bundles seemed to be safe in oncological and produced 
encouraging functional results. Further rigorous prospective studies with more 
patients and long-term follow-up data are needed to assess the oncologic and 
functional results.

Nuremberg, Germany.

PURPOSE: To explore the impact of ileal conduit (IC), orthotopic ileal 
neobladder, and MAINZ Pouch I on renal function (RF) over time.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, cohort study including consecutive 
patients who underwent open radical cystectomy due to bladder cancer from 
November 2013 to June 2022. RF deterioration was calculated based on the 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) through the CKD-EPI creatinine 
equation. A linear mixed-effects model was constructed, adjusting for multiple 
risk factors. The probability of achieving an eGFR reduction greater than 25% 
compared to baseline among different urinary diversion techniques was assessed 
using a Kaplan-Meier curve.
RESULTS: Overall, 107 patients received IC, 28 neobladder, and 20 MAINZ Pouch I. 
Those receiving IC were older and displayed more comorbidities. At follow-up, 
eGFR was lower by 0.09 mL/min/1.73m2 (confidence interval - 5.87 to 5.69, 
p = 0.975) in patients receiving neobladder compared to those receiving IC. 
Similarly, eGFR was higher by 4.64 mL/min/1.73m2 (confidence interval - 1.57 to 
10.85, p = 0.143) in patients receiving pouch compared to those receiving IC. 
Accordingly, patients with higher preoperative eGFR (p < 0.001), lower age 
(p = 0.048), non-T4 histological tumor (p = 0.027) and absence of septicemia at 
follow-up (p = 0.002) presented higher eGFR values at follow-up. The three UD 
techniques did not differ significantly in the time-to-event analysis (log-rank 
test = 0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients undergoing urinary diversion 
with IC, orthotopic ileal neobladder, or MAINZ Pouch I develop RF deterioration 
at follow-up. No significant differences were observed among the three UD 
techniques in terms of eGFR decline in the long-term.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the functional and oncological outcomes of 
females who underwent uterus-sparing radical cystectomy (USRC) and standard 
radical cystectomy (SRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2009 and December 2020, 90 female 
patients who underwent radical cystectomy with urinary diversion were included 
in this study, comprising the USRC and SRC groups. Functional outcomes were 
assessed in 63 patients who only underwent radical cystectomy with neobladder 
formation. Questionnaire scores, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) rate, 
and urinary continence rate were analyzed. Oncological outcomes were assessed in 
86 patients, regardless of the urinary diversion type. Overall survival (OS), 
cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 
compared.
RESULTS: CIC rate was significantly lower in the USRC group than in the SRC 
group (14.7% vs. 48.0%; p=0.005). The continence rate was significantly higher 
in the USRC group than in the SRC group (85.3% vs. 40.0%; p=0.001). There were 
no significant differences in OS (p=0.890), CSS (p=0.700), or RFS (p=0.270) 
between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, uterine preservation did not 
significantly increase the hazard ratio (HR) of OS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.18-2.11; 
p=0.450), CSS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.22-4.40; p=0.990), or RFS (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 
0.19-1.11; p=0.840).
CONCLUSIONS: USRC resulted in higher continence rates and lower CIC rates than 
SRC without negatively affecting oncological outcomes. Hence, with thorough 
deliberation, USRC should be considered for females undergoing radical 
cystectomy.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the learning curve for robot- assisted radical cystectomy 
(RARC) with total intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) in terms of both time 
efficiency and quality of surgery based on radical cystectomy (RC)-pentafecta.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 203 consecutive patients who underwent RARC 
with ICUD of the ileal conduit (IC, 85) and orthotopic neobladder (ONB, 118) 
performed by a single surgeon between 2011 and 2021. We grouped ten consecutive 
patients into time-associated blocks according to the operation order. Process 
efficiency and operation quality were measured based on the surgeon's console 
time and attainment/score sum of RC-pentafecta. The overcoming point of the 
learning curve was defined graphically and statistically.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 44.5 ± 30.7 months. Of the 203 patients, 
109 (53.7%) attained the five criteria of RC-pentafecta (ONB vs IC, 50.6% vs. 
55.9%, p = 0.35). The attainment rate and sum of the RC-pentafecta score of the 
third group were not significantly different from those of all patients (40.0% 
vs. 53.7%, p = 0.369, 4.00 ± 1.05 vs. 4.41 ± 0.75, p = 0.137, respectively), and 
the proficiency in operation quality was satisfactory in the third group. The 
console times continually improved and stabilized after the 140th case (IC, 60; 
ONB, 80), and the attainment rate and sum of the RC-pentafecta were 
significantly different between before and after the 140th case (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: A single surgeon's learning curve for RARC with ICUD and pelvic 
lymph node dissection (PLND) showed an acceptable level of proficiency after 30 
consecutive cases in terms of the operation quality. However, for an expert 
surgeon, 140 cases were required to reach a plateau in time efficiency and 
second leap with the RC-pentafecta. RARC with ICUD and PLND can be performed 
safely without compromising functional outcomes and complications through 
sharing and transmission of standardized techniques.

The concept of functional preservation after orthotopic neobladder construction 
has gradually attracted attention. Reconstruction of urine storage and voiding 
is the basic function preservation of orthotopic neobladder. Clinical 
exploration mainly focuses on the optimization of neobladder reconstruction 
methods and procedures, and there is still a lack of summary of existing 
surgical characteristics and high-quality functional comparative studies. For 
strictly selected patients, on the basis of tumor control and standardized 
postoperative rehabilitation guidance, most patients with preserved nerve can 
retain satisfied sexual function after surgery. The protection of neurovascular 
bundle and ancillary structures combined with postoperative exercise is crucial 
to the improvement of urinary continence. According to the characteristics of 
patients, choosing the appropriate urinary diversion methods and function 
preserving can help patients establish a normal life style after surgery and 
improve their self-image and quality of life.

OBJECTIVES: to assess the functional outcome of performing ureteric 
re-implantation to an angled short chimney in a modified spiral orthotopic ileal 
neobladder.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2020, 90 male patients with 
bladder cancer underwent radical cystectomy and spiral ileal neobladder 
reconstruction with a chimney. Patients were randomly divided in two groups 
according to the position of the chimney [straight and angled] to which the 
ureters will be implanted. Postoperative evaluation included clinical, 
laboratory, radiographic and urodynamic studies.
RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. The mean operative time for the 
procedure was 4.7 ± 1.2 h in group I and 4.9 ± 1.3 h in group II (p 0.456). No 
intraoperative complications occurred. Early postoperative complications 
occurred in 8 patients. In group I, according to the modified Clavien system, 
GII complication occurred in 2 (5%) patients in the form of DVT in 1 (2.5%) and 
surgical site infection in 1 (2.5%). GIIIa occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients in the 
form of wound dehiscence. In group II, GII occurred in 2 (4.8%) patients in the 
form of prolonged urinary leakage and myocardial infarction, each occurred in 
one patient. GIIIb occurred in 1 (2.4%) patient in the form of intestinal leak. 
Poucho-ureteral reflux occurred in 10 patients [3 (7.5%) in group I and 7 
(16.8%) in group II (p 0.001)].
CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results of the right sided angled chimney during 
neobladder reconstruction are safe, acceptable, without an extra time to develop 
an anti-reflux technique and without an increased incidence of reflux.

OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in complications following robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) using a multi-institutional database, the International 
Robotic Cystectomy Consortium (IRCC).
METHODS: A retrospective review of the IRCC database was performed (2976 
patients, 26 institutions from 11 countries). Postoperative complications were 
categorized as overall or high grade (≥ Clavien Dindo III) and were further 
categorized based on type/organ site. Descriptive statistics was used to 
summarize the data. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was used to identify variables 
associated with overall and high-grade complications.  Cochran-Armitage trend 
test was used to describe the trend of complications over time.
RESULTS: 1777 (60%) patients developed postoperative complications following 
RARC, 51% of complications occurred within 30 days of RARC, 19% between 30-90 
days, and 30% after 90 days. 835 patients (28%) experienced high-grade 
complications. Infectious complications (25%) were the most prevalent, while 
bleeding (1%) was the least. The incidence of complications was stable between 
2002-2021. Gastrointestinal and neurologic postoperative complications increased 
significantly (P < .01, for both) between 2005 and 2020 while thromboembolic 
(P = .03) and wound complications (P < .01) decreased. On MVA, BMI (OR 1.03, 
95%CI 1.01-1.05, P < .01), prior abdominal surgery (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.03-1.56, 
P = .03), receipt of neobladder (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.17-1.99, P < .01), positive 
nodal disease (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.05-1.70, P = .02), length of inpatient stay (OR 
1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.05, P < .01) and ICU admission (OR 1.67, 95%CI 1.36-2.06, P < 
.01) were associated with high-grade complications.
CONCLUSION: Overall and high-grade complications after RARC remained stable 
between 2002-2021. GI and neurologic complications increased, while 
thromboembolic and wound complications decreased.

In the last two decades, surgical techniques for intracorporeal urinary 
diversion have been developed with the aim of reducing surgical morbidity. 
Although increasing constantly, the numbers of urologists offering 
intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction remain limited due to the complex 
nature of the procedure. In this article, we aim to provide a detailed 
description of the surgical technique we currently use at our institution. This 
technique was initially developed and perfected at the Karolinska Institutet in 
Sweden starting in 2003. It is a reproducible surgical approach with 
standardized and well-defined surgical steps. We give a detailed description of 
the surgical steps and provide tips and tricks to address specific situations 
and to increase efficiency. We also review the indications, the preoperative 
considerations, equipment necessary, postoperative considerations, and clinical 
outcomes for this procedure. Finally, we provide an accompanying didactic 
surgical video. We believe that this standardized approach can be learned and 
reproduced safely by motivated robotic surgeons.

INTRODUCTION: Strictures and obliterations of ureteral anastomosis after radical 
cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder reconstruction occur in 8-13% of cases, 
mainly in the first 2 years after surgery. According to the European Association 
of Urology guidelines, open reconstruction is considered the "gold standard" for 
the treatment of those patients. At the same time, according to various 
publications, X-ray endoscopic treatment of ureteral anastomotic strictures can 
be performed, especially in patients who have undergone orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three clinical cases of endoscopic treatment of ureteral 
anastomotic obliteration after orthotopic neobladder formation are presented. In 
all patients, nephrostomy tube was initially put due to acute pyelonephritis. 
Obliteration of the ureteral anastomosis was diagnosed by contrast-enhanced 
multispiral computed tomography and antegrade pyelography. The length of 
obliteration in all patients did not exceed 1.0 cm. The recurrence of the 
bladder cancer was excluded. After percutaneous opacification of the 
pelvicalyceal system and advancement of two guidewires ("working" and "safety") 
to the level of ureteral obliteration, a catheter with a built-in fiber optic 
light source was put in antegrade fashion along the "working" guidewire to the 
area of obliteration. During transurethral inspection of the reservoir, the 
distal end of the light source was visualized and the reservoir wall was cut "to 
the light" using electrosurgery (n=2) and a thulium fiber laser (one case). For 
adequate kidney drainage, two internal stents of 6 Fr were put for a period of 6 
months in two patients and for 2 months in another case.
RESULTS: All patients had an adequate diameter of the ureteral anastomosis after 
removal of the stents. In two cases, an adequate passage of the contrast agent 
through both ureters was maintained for 42 and 37 months after procedure 
(according to the follow-up computed tomography and excretory urography). One 
patient had an attack of acute pyelonephritis 2 months after the removal of 
internal stents due to recurrent stricture. After repeated endoscopic ureteral 
recanalization with putting of two internal stents for a period of 6 months, no 
recurrence of the stricture was observed during 28 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic treatment of both primary and recurrent short ureteral 
anastomotic obliterations in patients with orthotopic neobladder allows for 
adequate ureteral patency, provided that two internal stents are left in place 
for 6 months.

INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
orthotopic neobladder creation is a complex surgical procedure, which is 
gradually becoming an alternative to open surgery.
AIM: To compare the perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes of open 
radical cystectomy (ORC) and RARC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RARC with ileocystoplasty was performed in 25 patients, 
including 24 men. The average age was 65.5 years. ORC was done in 30 patients 
(28 men; control group) with the mean age of 67.2 years. In RARC, the ureters 
were isolated at the level of lower thirds, the bladder was dissected from the 
rectum on both sides, then the bladder vessels were divided using clips, and the 
urethra was cut off. After pelvic lymph node dissection, 50 cm of the ileum was 
resected. Then two distal segments were folded in a U-shape, a 1.5 cm incision 
was made in the lower part, and an anastomosis with the urethra was carried out. 
Further, these segments were detubularized and a modified Studer reservoir was 
created. The ureters were implanted into the tubular part. In ORC, urine 
diversion was also done using Studer technique. In both groups, the operation 
time, the volume of blood loss, the number of complications, the duration of 
hospitalization, the proportion of daytime and nighttime continence were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean time for RARC and ORC was 380 (320-580) and 260 (220-320) min, 
respectively (p<0.05). In the group of RARC, the volume of blood loss was 85 
(50-250) ml and no blood transfusion was performed, while in ORC, the volume of 
blood loss was 520 (350-1400) ml, an average of 480 (0-840) ml of blood was 
transfused (p<0.05). After RARC, 30- and 90- complications rate was 32.0% (n=8) 
and 24.0% (n=6), respectively, compared to 40.0% (n=12) and 30.0% (n=9) in ORC. 
One patient died due to myocardial infarction during the 90-day follow-up period 
after RARC (grade V complication according to Clavien). The average number of 
removed lymph nodes in the RARC group was 15 (10-18). One patient had lymph node 
metastases. There were no cases of local recurrence. In ORC, the average number 
of lymph nodes was 16 (11-20), metastases were detected in 2 patients. One of 
them was subsequently diagnosed with local recurrence. There was no significant 
difference in the number of lymph nodes removed between two groups. After RARC, 
20 (80.0%) patients had complete urinary continence, while 5 patients (20.0%) 
used 1-2 pads per day. Night continence was preserved in 15 cases (60.0%). After 
ORC, complete urinary continence was seen in 23 cases (76.7%). Five patients 
(20.0%) used 1-2 pads per day and two patients (6.7%) used 2-3 pads per day. 
Night continence after ORC was preserved in 17 cases (56.7%).
CONCLUSION: RARC is a minimally invasive method of surgical treatment of 
patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Compared with ORC, a significantly 
lower rate of complications and blood transfusions is documented, but RARC 
requires a longer operation time. Both interventions provide the equivalent 
oncological and functional outcomes, which are in line with published data.

Staple Containing Ureteral Stone Formation After Robot-Assisted Radical 
Cystectomy With Intracorporeal Neobladder Construction in a Female Patient: A

Radical cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladder formation is a 
well-established treatment for patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer 
of the bladder. After the wide implementation of robotic systems, numerous 
centers increasingly offer intracorporeal neobladder construction using robotic 
staple devices. Stone formation at the area of staple material migration is a 
long-term complication, as staple material may migrate through the neobladder 
wall and act as a nidus for urine crystal aggregation. Stone formation in the 
upper urinary tract and the diversion segment is highly variable and 
corresponding management protocols are extensively reported in the previous 
series. However, the presence of staple material within a renal or ureteral 
stone has been rarely reported before. We present a case of a female patient 
with a staple-containing ureteral stone four years after radical cystectomy and 
neobladder formation and the consequent antegrade ureterorenoscopic retrieval. 
This treatment option is feasible, safe and easily implemented by experienced 
endourologists.

PURPOSE: With the increasing application of laparoscopic or robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy, a reliable and promising method is needed for reducing 
postoperative complications. We describe the short-term outcomes of totally 
extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy (TELRC) with extraperitoneal 
pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) and extraperitoneal ileal orthotopic 
neobladder (EION) techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2020 to December 2021, we performed TELRC 
and EPLND with EION in 72 patients in our center. The accompanying video 
highlights our novel techniques. The patients' demographic data, intraoperative 
data, and perioperative complications were collected, and short-term oncological 
and functional results are reported.
RESULTS: All procedures were technically successful without conversion to open 
surgery. The patients' mean body mass index was 26.22±5.71. Median age was 
57.51±12.34 years. Average hospital stay was 13.78±4.62 days. Median 
intraoperative blood loss was 112.92±88.56 mL. No blood transfusion was needed 
during the operations and only one blood transfusion was performed during the 
perioperative period. Mean operating time was 259.44±49.84 minutes. Average cost 
was US$9,875.71±1,873.08. Postoperative short-term complications included 
short-term ileus (n=3), infection (n=13), leakage of urine (n=11), and lymph 
fistula (n=7). One late complication of unilateral vesicoureteral anastomotic 
stenosis occurred. The mean follow-up was 13.42±8.77 months, and no patient 
developed local or systemic recurrence. The short-term follow-up and small 
cohort of patients limited our evaluation of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: TELRC with PLND and EION was technically feasible and clinically 
promising, with a reduced potential harm of postoperative complications. 
Long-term follow-up and a larger cohort of patients are needed for further 
study.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy for bladder cancer represents a high demolitive 
surgical procedure with a significative impact on quality of life. Sexuality 
preserving techniques have been proposed in order to improve functional 
outcomes. Although sex-sparing techniques would provide women with the chance of 
having pregnancy, experience is still limited when malignant conditions are 
considered. We report the outcomes of pregnancy and delivery in a 43-year-old 
woman with a Padua ileal orthotopic neobladder after robot-assisted sexuality 
preserving cystectomy for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer performed 
four years earlier, at age 39.
CASE PRESENTATION: Since pregnancy was confirmed, the patient had been under 
close urological and gynecological observation. Hydronephrosis and 
voiding-relating complications were reported and treated by inserting a 
nephrostomy tubes and indwelling bladder catheter. At the time of delivery, 
elective caesarian section was performed without complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexuality preserving cystectomy could be an option in selected and 
highly motivated young patients with diagnosis of bladder cancer. A 
multidisciplinary team of experts included gynecologists, urologists, 
radiologists, anesthesiologists and neonatologists is required for the optimal 
management of pregnancy and peripartum care in women with urinary diversion.

BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common paediatric soft-tissue 
sarcoma. Approximately 15-20% of RMS cases arise from the bladder and prostate 
(B/P). The optimal treatment strategy for B/P RMS remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate the applicability of our procedure 
performed to treat paediatric patients with B/P RMS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective analysis from a 
single tertiary referral hospital. From August 2003 to March 2021, 62 children 
pathologically diagnosed with B/P RMS underwent radical cystectomy and 
orthotopic detaenial sigmoid neobladder reconstruction in our centre.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Surgical procedures included laparoscopic radical cystectomy 
and detaenial sigmoid neobladder reconstruction, which is demonstrated in the 
accompanying video.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. 
Perioperative and long-term oncological and functional outcomes were reported. A 
logistic regression analysis was also performed.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: All surgeries, including three intracorporeal 
laparoscopic surgeries, were completed successfully. Of the 62 patients, 54 were 
alive without evidence of disease recurrence or metastasis at the last 
follow-up. Five of the 14 >12-yr-old boys reported that they experienced 
erections. Two female patients >12 yr old reported that they menstruated. 
However, this was a retrospective study conducted at a single centre with 
limited surgeon experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the safety and feasibility of primary 
orthotopic sigmoid neobladder reconstruction after radical cystectomy for 
paediatric patients with B/P RMS. Good outcomes in terms of oncological control 
and functional recovery were achieved. The high histocompatibility and tissue 
adaptability of children are inspiring.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We describe our stepwise technique of radical cystectomy and 
detaenial sigmoid neobladder reconstruction for paediatric patients with bladder 
and prostate rhabdomyosarcoma. With this technique, we were able to achieve good 
functional recovery without compromising cancer control and significantly 
increasing complications.

Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction is a continent urinary diversion 
procedure increasingly used in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
following radical cystectomy (RC). It represents a valid alternative to the 
ileal duct in suitable patients who do not prefer a stoma and are motivated to 
undergo adequate training of the neobladder. Careful patient selection, taking 
into account the absolute and relative contraindications for ONB as well as an 
adequate recovery protocol after surgery are integral to the success of this 
procedure and the oncological and functional outcomes. The objective of this 
review is to summarize the current data on RC with ONB in terms of patient 
selection, preoperative preparation, surgical techniques and functional 
(continence and sexual activity) and oncological outcomes, with particular 
attention to the management of complications and the impact on quality of life 
(QoL).

Recommendations regarding transversal topics applicable to bladder cancer 
patients independent of tumor grade and stage were established by members of the 
Spanish Oncology Genitourinary Multidisciplinary Working Group (SOGUG). Liquid 
biopsy in urine and blood samples is useful in the surveillance of 
non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer, respectively. 
Multiparametric MRI is an accurate, faster and non-invasive staging method 
overcoming the understaging risk of other procedures. The combination of 
FDG-PET/MRI could improve diagnostic reliability, but definite criteria for 
imaging interpretation are still unclear. Hospital oncology pharmacists as 
members of tumor committees improve the safety of drug use. Additionally, safety 
recommendations during BCG preparation should be strictly followed. The initial 
evaluation of patients with bladder cancer should include a multidimensional 
geriatric assessment. Orthotopic neobladder reconstruction should be offered to 
motivated patients with full information of self-care requirements. 
Bladder-sparing protocols, including chemoradiation therapy and immune 
checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs), should be implemented in centers with 
well-coordinated multidisciplinary teams and offered to selected patients. The 
optimal strategy of treatment with ICIs should be defined from the initial 
diagnostic phase with indications based on scientific evidence. Centralized 
protocols combined with the experience of professional groups are needed for the 
integral care of bladder cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the short-term burden associated with continent diversion 
relative to ileal conduit creation.
METHODS: Bladder cancer patients who underwent radical cystectomy in 2019 and 
2020 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
Improvement Program database using current procedural terminology codes and 
pathology reports. Patients were grouped by urinary diversion performed: ileal 
conduit versus continent diversion (neobladder or cutaneous reservoir). Multiple 
logistic regression was used to examine the association between type of urinary 
diversion and 30-day outcomes, including postoperative complications, all-cause 
readmissions, and mortality, adjusting for baseline differences.
RESULTS: Of 4,755 patients who underwent radical cystectomy, 677 underwent 
continent diversion (14.2%). These patients were significantly younger (median 
62 vs 71 years, P <.01) and less likely to have diabetes (13.6% vs 20.1%, P 
<.01), COPD (3.7% vs 7.1%, P<0.01), and prior pelvic radiation (5.5% vs 13.1%, P 
<.01). A greater proportion of continent diversion patients experienced a 
postoperative complication (56.0% vs 48.9%, P <.01) and all-cause readmission 
(30.3% vs 20.4%, P <.0). After adjustment, continent diversion patients had 1.4 
(95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4-2.1) times the odds of experiencing a 
postoperative complication or all-cause readmission, respectively. There was no 
statistically significant difference in mortality (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.5-2.9).
CONCLUSION: Compared to ileal conduit creation, continent urinary diversion is 
associated with increased odds of postoperative complications and readmission to 
the hospital within 30 days of surgery. Bladder cancer patients undergoing 
cystectomy and seeking continent diversion should be counseled on the increased 
short-term morbidity associated with this specific type of diversion.

PURPOSE: Few data exist regarding the functional outcomes of robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the urodynamic and functional outcomes in patients 
undergoing RARC and totally intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder for bladder 
cancer.
METHODS: In this monocentric, observational study carried out between 2016 and 
2020, consecutive patients undergoing RARC and intracorporeal orthotopic 
neobladder in the Department of Urology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, were 
included. Reconstruction was totally intracorporeal Y-shaped neobladder. Main 
outcomes were urodynamic findings 6 months post-surgery, continence and quality 
of life (QoL). Continence was defined by no pad or one safety pad. International 
Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), International Index of 
Erectile Function questionnaire (IIEF-5) and Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) scores 
were recorded.
RESULTS: Fourteen male patients were included (median age: 64 years [IQR 54-67]. 
Median maximal neobladder cystometric capacity was 495 ml [IQR 410-606] and 
median compliance was 35.5 ml/cm H2O [IQR 28-62]. All patients had post-void 
residual volume < 30 ml, except for three (22%) who required clean 
intermittent-self catheterisation. Daytime continence was achieved in 10 
patients (71%) and night-time continence in two (14.3%). Median ICIQ score was 7 
[IQR 5-11]. Postoperative erectile function was present in 7% of patients (mean 
IIEF-5 = 5 [IQR 2-7]). Thirteen patients (93%) were satisfied with their choice 
of neobladder.
CONCLUSION: RARC with totally intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder for bladder 
cancer provides satisfactory urodynamic results and good QoL. These findings 
should be confirmed long-term.

PURPOSE: The incidence of urethral recurrence (UR) following radical cystectomy 
(RC) for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder varies between 1.5 and 
6%. There is debate over the timing of urethrectomy for patients undergoing RC. 
We evaluated the requirement for a formal surveillance programme for UR in 
patients after RC.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients who underwent RC 
between 2006 and 2019. Females, non-TCC cases and patients with neo-bladder 
diversions were excluded. Histological prostatic urethral involvement at the 
time of RC was deemed high risk for UR. Carcinoma in-situ, multifocal tumours 
and bladder neck involvement were deemed intermediate risk and the absence of 
the above features was considered low risk.
RESULTS: 417 patients underwent RC, 300 cases remained after exclusion criteria 
were applied. 42 patients were high-risk for UR, 102 patients were intermediate 
risk and 156 were low risk. Of the 300, 24 urethrectomy cases were recorded. Six 
cases of UR occurred. Of these, 5 presented with symptoms and only 1 case was 
detected by surveillance. Only 1 low-risk patient developed UR, 7 years post RC. 
Using our risk stratification, UR rates for high, intermediate and low-risk 
cohorts were 25%, 10.5% and 0.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, routine surveillance for all patients with annual 
urethroscopy was of limited value in detecting UR post RC. Staged Urethrectomy 
for high and intermediate-risk patients, and patient counselling in 
self-identification of recurrence symptoms for low-risk patients will improve 
the early detection of UR.

INTRODUCTION: The Italian Radical Cystectomy Registry (Registro Italiano 
Cistectomie - RIC) aimed to analyse outcomes of a multicenter series of patients 
treated with radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study 
was performed to collect data from RC and urinary diversion via open (ORC), 
laparoscopic (LRC), or robotic-assisted (RARC) techniques performed in 28 
Italian Urological Departments. The enrolment was planned from January 2017 to 
June 2020 (goal: 1000 patients), with a total of 1425 patients included. 
Chi-square and t-tests were used for categorical and continuous variables. All 
tests were 2-sided, with a significance level set at p <0.05.
RESULTS: Overall median operative-time was longer in RARCs (390 minutes, IQR 
335-465) than ORCs (250, 217-309) and LRCs (292, 228-350) (p <0.001). Lymph node 
dissection (LND) was performed more frequently in RARCs (97.1%) and LRCs (93.5%) 
than ORCs (85.6%) (p <0.001), with extended-LND performed 2-fold more frequently 
in RARCs (61.6%) (p <0.001). The neobladder rate was significantly higher (more 
than one-half) in RARCs. The median estimated blood loss (EBL) rate was lower in 
RARCs (250 ml, 165-400) than LRCs (330, 200-600) and ORCs (400, 250-600) (p 
<0.001), with intraoperative blood transfusion rates of 11.4%, 21.7% and 35.6%, 
respectively (p <0.001). The conversion to open rate was slightly higher in 
RARCs (6.8%) than LRCs (4.3%). Intraoperative complications occurred in 1.3% of 
cases without statistically significant differences among the approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from the RIC confirmed the need to collect as much data as 
possible in a multicenter manner. RARCs proves to be feasible with perioperative 
complication rates that do not differ from the other approaches.

Orthotopic neobladder is a well-established surgical solution for continent 
urinary diversion after radical cystectomy. Nevertheless, it still represents a 
challenging surgery. Some critical issues of orthotopic bladder substitution 
include relevant complication rates, renal function impairment, urinary 
incontinence and patient quality of life. We present a new ileal neobladder 
technique, Vesuvian Orthotopic Neobladder (VON), performed for the first time at 
our institution in 2020. The main purpose of this new surgical procedure is to 
simplify and speed up the reservoir reconstruction through a ten standardized 
technical steps and obtain an appropriate bladder capacity at the same time.   
METHODS: Inclusion criteria were muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma or non 
muscle-invasive high risk bladder cancer patients fit for bladder substitution. 
The exclusion criteria were locally advanced cancer, presence of hydronephrosis, 
renal or hepatic impairment. A chest-abdominal CT scan and urinary cytology were 
performed before the procedure. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as 
required. Overall, operative time, bladder reconfiguration time, hospitalization 
time, catheterization time were recorded. All complications associated with the 
procedure were classified according to the Clavien Dindo score. The bladder 
volume was evaluated by ultrasound three months after the surgery.   RESULTS: A 
total of six male patients diagnosed with non-metastatic muscle-invasive or 
high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy 
followed by VON reconfiguration were included in the study. Mean age was 62.8 
(±4.9) years; all selected patients enjoyed good health conditions (Charlson 
Comorbidity Index 4-6). One patient presented with high-risk non-muscle invasive 
bladder cancer. Four patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mean overall 
operative time was 273.3 (±18.6) minutes. Average time for neobladder 
reconstruction was 63.7 (±16.1) minutes. There were no intraoperative 
complications. A single case of urethral anastomosis leakage occurred and was 
treated conservatively. Bladder volume on ultrasound evaluation ranged between 
250 and 290 ml.  Day time and nocturnal continence were observed in four and 
three patients, respectively.   CONCLUSION: The new VON technique is a good 
alternative to traditional orthotopic bladder procedures. VON reconstruction 
seems to offer the advantage of speeding up the procedure, reducing intestinal 
compromise with good storage capacity. The ten surgical steps can be considered 
a good starting point for further improvements in surgical technique. More 
robust data regarding the number of procedures and the duration of follow-up is 
required.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Majority of patients undergoing radical cystectomy are 
suitable for orthotopic urinary diversion. The effect of different techniques of 
neobladder reconstruction on early and long-term postoperative complications is 
still being determined. Additionally, it is unclear which type of neobladder 
provides the best patient satisfaction. The purpose of this article is to review 
the outcomes of different orthotopic urinary diversions following radical 
cystectomy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ileal neobladder is the preferred type of orthotopic urinary 
diversion following radical cystectomy. Hautmann and Studer, which are the most 
common orthotopic diversion techniques, provide daytime continence rate up to 
87% and 92%, respectively. However, nighttime continence is achieved in about 
50% of patients. High-level evidence supports the long-term safety of orthotopic 
neobladder in terms of renal function, even in patients with a glomerular 
filtration rate <60 ml/min. Sexual dysfunction is the only independent factor 
associated with poorer quality of life in these patients.
SUMMARY: The best type of neobladder is still uncertain. However, Studer and 
Hautmann are the most commonly performed techniques that provide favorable 
short- and long-term outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the 
available literature regarding the postoperative effects of anti-reflux 
anastomosis and direct anastomosis in orthotopic ileal neobladder (ONB).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library in October 2021. 
We included 11 studies of patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical 
cystectomy and ONB as urinary diversion. Outcomes evaluated in this review were 
ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture (UEAS), vesicoureteral reflux, renal 
function (RFn) impairment, and pyelonephritis. All data were analyzed using 
Review Manager 5.4.4 and subgroup analyses were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. The synthetic 
data suggested that anti-reflux anastomosis and direct anastomosis were 
comparable in terms of RFn impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69; 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.18-15.6; p = 0.65, I2 = 69%) and pyelonephritis (OR = 1.13; 95% 
CI: 0.65-1.99; p = 0.66, I2 = 1%) without significant difference in each group 
statistically. The pooled study data showed a significantly higher incidence of 
UEAS (OR = 2.84; 95% CI: 1.75-4.61, p < 0.0001, I2 = 50%) and a lower incidence 
of vesicoureteral reflux (OR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.10-0.59; p = 0.002, I2 = 75%) in 
anti-reflux anastomosis compared to direct anastomosis. In subgroup analysis, 
anti-reflux anastomosis was more likely to result in UEAS than direct 
anastomosis, especially when ureteral stent was removed within 14 days.
CONCLUSION: Although meta-analysis showed that overall incidence of 
vesicoureteral reflux was higher with direct anastomosis than anti-reflux 
anastomosis, the rate of vesicoureteral reflux was not directly related to 
impairment of RFn. The anti-reflux mechanism of ONB was positively associated 
with a higher incidence of significant UEAS compared to the direct approach, 
which can lead to kidney damage and an increased risk of secondary surgical 
procedures.

PURPOSE: An entero-neovesical fistula (ENF) is a rare troublesome complication 
of an orthotopic ileal bladder substitution. We report on a novel, safe 
technique to close ileal neovesical fistulas without extensive adhesiolysis 
using an NK-stapler (ENDOPATH® ENDOCUTTER ETS; Johnson & Johnson, Cincinnati, 
OH, USA).
PATIENTS: We treated two cases of postoperative ENF after orthotopic ileal 
bladder substitution for radical cystectomy. Case 1 was a 63-year-old male with 
occasional fecaluria, and Case 2 was a 73-year-old male who experienced 
continuous fecaluria.Surgical procedureAfter laparotomy, we mobilized the 
ascending colon to bypass the anastomosis of the primary surgery by an 
ileo-ileal, ileo-ascending colon anastomosis. The distance between the fistula 
and bypass was about 10 cm. We made tunnels in the mesentery between the bypass 
and fistula, without damaging blood vessels, to insert the jaw of the 
NK-stapler. We closed the afferent and efferent loops using NK-staplers (45 mm 
×2), followed by a Lembert anastomosis covering the stapler's suture lines.
RESULTS: They were discharged on the ninth and seventh postoperative days, 
respectively. In Case 1, we experienced recanalization of the fistula after 
three postoperative months and required second closure with the same procedure 
was needed. They have not experienced any symptoms of ENF since.
CONCLUSIONS: This technique is worth considering for the surgical treatment of 
ENF because it does not require unnecessary dissection and can ultimately 
achieve fistula closure.

OBJECTIVES: To clarify the incidence of postoperative hydronephrosis and verify 
the validity of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for hydronephrosis after 
cystectomy and urinary diversion for bladder cancer.
METHODS: Totally, 290 patients receiving urinary diversion from 2005 through 
2017 with complete data were enrolled, including 258 (89.0%) with an ileal 
conduit and 32 (11.0%) with an ileal neobladder. Postoperative radiographic 
images were reviewed. In patients with postoperative hydronephrosis, antegrade 
pyelography and ureteroscopy were performed to exclude malignant etiology. 
Balloon dilation and open surgical revision were performed according to the 
conditions.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients (58 renal units) developed postoperative 
hydronephrosis. The cumulative incidence was 11.4% by a median follow-up of 
59.5 months. Ureteral recurrence was detected by antegrade examinations in two 
patients, whereas malignant strictures were subsequently revealed in three 
patients. Thus, malignant etiology was found in hydronephrosis in five renal 
units (12.8%) of five patients (16.1%). The median times to diagnosis of 
hydronephrosis were 0 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-4) and 14 months (IQR 9-12) 
for benign and malignant strictures, respectively (p = 0.003). Of them, 31 
patients (39 renal units) received interventions. Balloon dilation was performed 
in 13 renal units with benign strictures, and was successful in two (15.4%). 
Open surgical revision was performed in eight patients (11 renal units), 
including two with failed balloon dilation, all of which was successful.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative hydronephrosis is potentially associated with 
recurrent disease. Accurate differential diagnosis is challenging although 
antegrade procedures may be helpful in some cases. Open surgical revision is 
highly effective to treat benign strictures.

BACKGROUND: Orthotopic neobladder reconstruction has become the preferred method 
of urinary diversion after radical cystectomy in major medical centers. We 
performed modified Y-shaped ileal orthotopic neobladder reconstruction and 
presented the functional results and postoperative complications of the modified 
surgery.
METHODS: We included 21 patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical 
cystectomy at our center between February 2019 and December 2019. All patients 
underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy and lymph node 
dissection plus modified Y-shaped ileal orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. We 
collected the demographic and pathological history of the patients, and 
perioperative and postoperative functional outcomes and postoperative 
complications were recorded.
RESULTS: All surgeries were successful and no serious postoperative 
complications occurred. The mean operative time was 321.43 ± 54.75 min, 
including 101.67 ± 10.88 min required for neobladder reconstruction. Liquid 
intake was encouraged about 5 days after surgery, stent and catheter were 
removed after 13.52 ± 3.28 days, and the patients were discharged 1-2 days after 
removing the catheter. No ureteral anastomotic and neobladder urethral 
anastomotic strictures occurred. The volume of the neobladder at 1-year 
post-surgery was 195.24 ± 16.07 mL and the maximum urinary flow rate was 
20.64 ± 2.22 mL/s.
CONCLUSION: We describe the robotic-assisted modified Y-shaped ileal orthotopic 
neobladder reconstruction performed at our center, which requires a simple 
suture and short neobladder construction time, minimizes the occurrence of 
anastomotic stenosis, facilitates smooth patient emptying, and is clinically 
scalable and applicable.

BACKGROUND: Ileal neobladder fistula is a rare complication after radical 
cystectomy, with an incidence of approximately 0.7%. At present, there are 
scattered reports of vesicoileal fistula, but there are no reports of ileal 
neobladder fistula (INF) caused by bladder stones. In this paper, a case of 
ileal neobladder fistula caused by chronic stimulation of bladder stones was 
successfully diagnosed and treated.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man who had undergone radical cystectomy and an 
orthotopic ileal neobladder procedure 10 years prior presented with refractory 
diarrhoea and oliguria and was diagnosed with ileal neobladder fistula caused by 
chronic stimulation of bladder stones. We performed fistulectomy, cystotomy, 
partial ileectomy, and end-to-end ileal anastomosis, and the patient recovered 
and was discharged after the operation.
CONCLUSION: Urinary calculi are delayed complications of orthotopic neobladder 
construction after total cystectomy. Bladder stones are a rare complication of 
ileal neovesical fistula, which can cause neovesical cutaneous fistula. It is 
difficult to diagnose through routine examination and easily misdiagnosed as 
acute gastroenteritis. Surgery is an effective treatment for INF and can achieve 
a good prognosis.

PURPOSE: To examine postoperative complications after radical cystectomy (RC) 
and creation of an ileum conduit (IC) or a neobladder (NB), and to identify 
preoperative risk factors in a contemporary series of bladder cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study relied on prospectively collected data for 842 
patients, who underwent inpatient rehabilitation (IR) after RC and urinary 
diversion (IC n = 447, NB n = 395) between April 2018 and December 2019. 
Postoperative complications until the end of IR were assessed according to the 
Clavien-Dindo classification. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to 
identify predictors for complications.
RESULTS: A total of 2689 complications occurred in 813 patients (96.6%). 
High-grade complications occurred more frequently before IR onset (25.5% vs. 
5.7%; P < .001), whereas a higher percentage of low-grade complications occurred 
during IR (89.0% vs. 77.8%; P < .001). The most common complication categories 
were genitourinary (60.9%), infectious (54.0%) and gastrointestinal (49.2%). 
Rates of high-grade complications do not differ between IC and NB patients 
(26.8% vs. 31.6%, P = .126). Independent predictors for overall complications 
were NB (odds ratio [OR] 21.520; P < .001), age ≥70 years (OR 2.522; P = .027) 
and higher body mass index (OR 1.153, P = .008). Risk factors for high-grade 
complications were NB (OR 1.448; P = .039) and Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2 (OR 
1.999; P = .001). Hospital readmission rate was 9.4%.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed significantly higher overall and high-grade 
complication rates after RC with IC or NB creation than previously published. A 
high percentage of low-grade complications occur after hospital discharge. The 
hospital readmission rate was lower compared to historical data.

INTRODUCTION: Patients undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer are at an 
increased risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) due to prolonged 
antibiotics and underlying comorbidities. We aim to evaluate CDI risk factors in 
cystectomy patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 
(NSQIP), patients undergoing cystectomy with diagnosis of bladder cancer between 
2015-2017 were included. Baseline demographics including age, sex, 
comorbidities, and preoperative labs were collected. Univariate and 
multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate risk factors for and 
complications of CDI during the index hospitalization.
RESULTS: There were a total of 6,432 patients included in the analysis, with 
6,242 (96%) and 190 (4%) in the non-CDI vs. CDI groups, respectively. Patients 
with a diagnosis of postoperative CDI were more likely to be female [4.09% vs. 
2.71%, p = 0.001] and have lower preoperative albumin [3.78 g/dL (0.52) vs. 3.92 
g/dL (0.48), p = 0.003]. Patients with a history of female sex (OR 1.46, p = 
0.03), neobladder (OR 1.57, p = 0.01), and low preoperative albumin (OR 1.45, p 
= 0.04) were at the highest risk for development of CDI postoperatively. 
Patients with a diagnosis of CDI were more likely to experience readmission 
within 30 days (31.1% vs. 19.2%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Utilizing the NSQIP database, we identified predictors for 
development of CDI in cystectomy patients. Female sex, continent diversion, and 
low preoperative albumin all significantly increased the rate of CDI. While our 
findings are retrospective, they are compelling enough to warrant further 
prospective investigation.

University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.

OBJECTIVE: To show the effective and successful technical approach of 
percutaneous embolization for persistent urine leakage that occurred after 
orthotopic neobladder formation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent 
percutaneous embolization of N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and lipiodol mixture 
after orthotopic neobladder formation at the Seoul National University Hospital 
(Seoul, Korea) from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020.
RESULTS: Among total of 182 patients of neobladder formation, five patients 
(four males and one female) were enrolled in this study, and their median age 
was 61.0 years (interquartile range (IQR): 42.5-69.5 years). All the patients 
showed persistent urine leakage at the neobladder-urethral anastomosis site and 
percutaneous drainage was primarily performed. The median time to perform 
percutaneous embolization was 40 days (IQR: 31.5-71.5 days) postoperatively. 
Elective two-staged embolization was performed in three cases for large diameter 
with a large fluid-filled cavity, while re-embolization was needed for delayed 
recurrence of urine leakage in two cases. Complete resolution of urine leakage 
was seen in all the cases and the median time to leakage closure was 55 days 
(IQR: 27.5-82.5 days). The median follow-up period after leakage closure was 26 
months (IQR: 15.5-36.4 months), and embolization material-related bladder stone 
was a noticeable complication (two cases) during follow-up, which was removed 
endoscopically within 1 year after embolization. All patients' quality of life 
(EQ-5D-5L score) was well-maintained during the entire period.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent urine leakage after neobladder formation can be 
effectively managed with percutaneous embolization of "dumbbell technique" by 
reinforcing the closure of leakage tract from inner opening to the outer opening 
even for large diameter (>1 cm).

PURPOSE: To evaluate urinary outcomes of pelvic construction and lateral capsule 
sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal 
neobladder (RARC-OIN).
METHODS: A total of 107 male patients who underwent RARC-OIN during January 2017 
and February 2021 in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital were analyzed 
retrospectively. Standard RARC-OIN with or without nerve sparing technique was 
performed in 44 patients (standard group), lateral prostate capsule sparing 
technique was performed in 20 patients (LCS group), combined pelvic 
reconstruction (CPR) technique including anterior suspension and posterior 
reconstruction were performed in 43 patients (CPR group). The urinary function 
was assessed by the use of pads and the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI). Continence 
was defined as the use of 0-1 pad during daytime or night-time.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the three groups regarding 
demographic, perioperative, and pathological data. Continence rates were 6.8, 
50.0 and 34.9% for daytime, 4.6, 40.0 and 32.6% for night-time in the standard 
group, LCS group and CPR group at 1 month post-operation, respectively. 
Continence rates were 34.1, 80.0 and 69.8% for daytime, 27.3, 75.0 and 65.1% for 
night-time in the standard group, LCS group and CPR group at 3 month 
post-operation, respectively. No statistically significant difference was 
observed in the daytime and night-time continence rates at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Lateral capsule-sparing and combined pelvic reconstruction 
techniques are feasible to improve early daytime and night-time continence rates 
in RARC with orthotopic neobladder.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to implement our technique for the 
initial dissection of the inferior hypogastric plexus and protection of the 
autonomic nerve supply to the corpora cavernosa in laparoscopic radical 
cystoprostatectomy with an orthotopic ileal neobladder and report the initial 
outcomes.
METHODS: Eleven normally potent patients with preoperative cT2N0 bladder cancer 
who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing laparoscopic cystoprostatectomy performed 
by the same surgeon were selected from May 2018 to September 2020. In this 
procedure, the anterior part of the inferior hypogastric plexus was dissected 
first between the prehypogastric nerve fascia and rectal proper fascia medial to 
the distal ureter. Then the Denonvilliers' fascia and the nerves around the 
prostate were preserved according to current intrafascial principles. The 
preliminary operative, oncologic, and functional results are presented.
RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 18 months. We observed early and late 
complications in 5 patients, but none exceeded grade III. Of the 11 patients, 
ten gained daytime continence (90.9%), and 8 (72.7%) showed nocturnal continence 
at the last follow-up. Regarding postoperative potency, 10 of the 11 patients 
(90.9%) remained potent with or without oral medications, excluding one who had 
partial tumescence but did not follow our recommendations regarding medication 
use. No local recurrence or positive surgical margins were noted.
CONCLUSION: In addition to emphasizing our cavernosal nerve-sparing procedure, 
this report on the precise dissection and protection of the inferior hypogastric 
plexus could be of clinical significance, providing potentially ideal short-term 
functional results.

BACKGROUND: The utilisation of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with 
intracorporeal reconstruction (iRARC) has increased in recent years. Little is 
known about the length of the learning curve (LC) for this procedure.
OBJECTIVE: To study the length of the LC for iRARC in terms of 90-d major 
complications (MC90; Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3), 90-d overall complications (OC90, 
Clavien-Dindo grades 1-5), operating time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), and 
length of hospital stay (LOS).
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective analysis of all 
consecutive iRARC cases from nine European high-volume hospitals with ≥100 
cases. All patients had bladder cancer for which iRARC was performed, with an 
ileal conduit or neobladder as the urinary diversion.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Outcome parameters used as a 
proxy for LC length were the number of consecutive cases needed to reach a 
plateau level in two-piece mixed-effects models for MC90, OC90, OT, EBL, and 
LOS.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 2186 patients undergoing iRARC between 2003 
and 2018were included. The plateau levels for MC90 and OC90 were reached after 
137 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 80-193) and 97 cases (95% CI 41-154), 
respectively. The mean MC90 rate at the plateau was 14% (95% CI 7-21%). The 
plateau level was reached after 75 cases (95% CI 65-86) for OT, 88 cases (95% CI 
70-106) for EBL, and 198 cases (95% CI 130-266) for LOS. A major limitation of 
the study is the difference in the balance of urinary diversion types between 
centres.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre retrospective analysis for the iRARC LC among nine 
European centres showed that 137 consecutive cases were needed to reach a stable 
MC90 rate.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We carried out a multicentre analysis of the surgical learning 
curve for robot-assisted removal of the bladder and bladder reconstruction in 
patients with bladder cancer. We found that 137 consecutive cases were needed to 
reach a stable rate of serious complications.

Radical cystectomy (RC) often affects patients' life as this surgery is a 
traumatic and invasive event for the patients, with drawbacks on their daily, 
social, working, and sex life. Such changes in the quality of life (QoL) of 
patients are commonly studied through retrospective clinical evaluations and 
rarely with longitudinal studies. To date, studies focusing on functional 
outcomes, sexual function, and health-related QoL for female patients are 
lacking. We evaluated 37 patients using EORTC QLQ-C30 (QLQ-30) and Short-Form 36 
(SF-36) questionnaires, before and after surgery, at 3 and 6 months of 
follow-up. The mean values for the emotional functioning in QLQ-C30 as well as 
the mental health in SF-36 were significantly higher in the ONB group compared 
to the IC group at 3 months of follow-up. These differences were not significant 
at 6 months of follow-up. At 6 months of follow-up, the ONB group showed a 
higher mean score in the physical and role functioning than the IC group. 
Although there was a statistically significant age difference at baseline of the 
two groups, none of the results are correlated with age, as demonstrated by 
Spearman's analysis. The ONB seems to represent the most advantageous solution 
compared to the IC in terms of QOL at the 6-month follow-up.

INTRODUCTION: In cases of ileal neobladder following radical cystectomy for the 
treatment of bladder cancer, tumor development in the isolated gut segment is 
extremely rare. Herein, we report a case of squamous cell and urothelial 
carcinomas in the ileal neobladder 23 years after radical cystectomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man was referred to our hospital for further 
examination of a solitary tumor in an ileal neobladder. At the age of 48 years, 
he underwent radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder reconstruction. 
Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed, and 
histopathological findings showed squamous cell carcinoma with high-grade 
urothelial carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of squamous cell and 
urothelial carcinomas in an ileal neobladder. While secondary tumor development 
in an ileal neobladder is rare, it is a cause for concern as a late 
postoperative adverse event. Therefore, long-term follow-ups are recommended.

INTRODUCTION: FloRIN reconfiguration technique was introduced in 2016 according 
to the IDEAL-Collaboration Guidelines, with the attempt to conjugate the 
advantages of both intracorporeal neobladder and robotic assistance. Herein we 
report functional outcomes of FloRIN reservoir, specifically focusing on 
urodynamic features.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with RARC and FloRIN 
reconstruction were prospectively collected from February 2016 to June 2020. 
Only patients with a minimum 6-month follow up were analyzed to obtain a stable 
grade of neobladder maturation before performing the urodynamic study (UDS). The 
FACT-BL and the QLQ-C30 EORTC questionnaires were used to evaluate urinary 
function and health-related QoL. Results were compared with a contemporary 
series of patients treated at the same Institution with open radical cystectomy 
(ORC) and Vescica Ileale Padovana (VIP).
RESULTS: One hundred patients entered the study and 69 patients had complete 
functional data. Overall, 52 (75.4%) patients reached the daytime continence. 
Among these, 28 (40.6%) were dry (no pads during daytime), while 24 (34.8%) used 
one pad/12 h. Night-time continence was achieved by 45 (65.2%) patients. 
Complete UDS findings were available for 28 patients. No statistically 
significant differences were found with the VIP-ORC group except for neobladder 
compliance, being higher in the FloRIN group (p = 0.03). When evaluating QoL 
scores, RARC with FloRIN reconfiguration showed a better continence recovery, as 
well as a higher improvement in urgency domain (p = 0.01), psychological status 
(0.02) and physical self-acceptance (p = 0.02), compared to the VIP-ORC group.
CONCLUSIONS: The FloRIN technique showed excellent functional outcomes when 
compared to the referral VIP-ORC procedure.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a decade of our experience with a neo-urethral 
modification of ileal orthotopic neobladder (pitcher pot ONB). Multiple 
investigators have reported similar modifications. However, long-term 
longitudinal functional and quality of life (QOL) outcomes are lacking.
METHODS: Prospectively maintained hospital registry for 238 ONB patients 
comprising a mix of open and robotic surgery cohorts from 2007 to 2017, and 
minimum of 2 years of follow-up was retrospectively queried. QOL was evaluated 
using Bladder Cancer Index (BCI). Longitudinal trends of QOL domain parameters 
were analysed. List of perioperative variables that have a biologically 
plausible association with continence, potency, and post-operative BCI QOL 
sexual, urinary, and bowel domain scores was drawn. Variables included surgery 
type, Body Mass Index (BMI), T and N stage, neurovascular bundle (NVB) sparing, 
age, and related pre-operative BCI QOL domain score. Prognostic associations 
were analysed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and multilevel 
mixed-effects modeling.
RESULTS: The study comprised 80 and 158 patients who underwent open and robotic 
sandwich technique cohorts, respectively. Open surgery was associated with 
significantly higher "any" complication (40% vs 27%, P-value .050) and "major" 
complication rate (15% vs 11%, P-value .048). All patients developed a bladder 
capacity >400 cc with negligible post-void residual urine, and all but one 
patient achieved spontaneous voiding by the end of study period (<1% clean 
intermittent self-catheterization [CISC] rate). By 15 months, QOL for all three 
domains had recovered to reach a plateau. About 45% of patients achieved 
potency, and the median time to achieve day and night time continence was 9 and 
12 months respectively. Lower age and NVBs spared during surgery were found to 
be significantly associated with the earlier achievement of potency, day and 
night time continence, as well as better urinary and sexual summary QOL scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Pitcher pot neobladder achieves satisfactory long-term functional 
and QOL outcomes with negligible CISC rate. Results were superior with 
incremental nerves spared during surgery.

A 67-year-old man presented with gross hematuria. The patient underwent 
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer 8 years ago. 
Metachronous bladder cancer (pT1, high-grade and pTis) was diagnosed by 
transurethral resection. Laparoscopic radical cystectomy and construction of an 
ileal neobladder were performed. During the operation, mild adhesion was 
observed between the bladder and rectum ; however, there were no intraoperative 
complications. The patient had dysuria 2 months postoperatively, and 
neovesical-urethral anastomotic stricture was revealed by cystoscopy. We 
performed transurethral incision, and the patient voided properly except for 
mild incontinence. There was no evidence of recurrence 4 years after the 
operation.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is one of the most common genitourinary cancers. 
Traditional transperitoneal radical cystectomy is the gold standard treatment 
for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Our study was to compare the perioperative 
and oncological outcomes of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy 
(ELRC) with intracorporeal neobladder versus transperitoneal urinary diversion 
for bladder cancer.
METHOD: A total of 113 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical cystectomy 
performed at our center were included in this retrospective study. The 
perioperative data of the extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy (ELRC) 
with intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) and transperitoneal laparoscopic 
radical cystectomy (TLRC) with ICUD groups were compared. The demographic, 
perioperative, oncological, and complication data were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 113 patients were enrolled for the final analysis. The median 
follow-up period was 22 months. The ELRC group had shorter interval to flatus (p 
< 0.001), solid food (p < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (p < 0.01), 
and fewer early gastrointestinal complications (p < 0.05). Furthermore, urinary 
continence, recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival rates and 
recurrence patterns did not significantly differ.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical technique of ELRC with ICUD can achieve the established 
oncologic criteria of TLRC, and such technique can improve perioperative and 
early postoperative outcomes.

PURPOSE: The prevalence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) 
varies from 5% to 8.2%, and the risk of infection increases by 5% to 7% per day 
of primary indwelling. We investigated whether a novel biofilm inhibitory 
mechanism using an inhibitory silicone urethral catheter (a coated Foley 
catheter) can reduce CAUTIs compared to conventional non-coated Foley catheters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study prospectively analyzed the difference in the 
incidence of CAUTIs in patients who underwent radical cystectomy with an 
orthotopic neobladder for bladder cancer and received a coated or conventional 
non-coated catheter. Additionally, differences in bacterial colonization between 
the groups were analyzed using a catheter-tip bacterial culture test.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were randomized into the "coated Foley catheter" 
group (abbreviated as "case" group; 41 patients) and a control group (44 
patients). The two groups were identical except for their surgical history. The 
incidence of CAUTIs 2 weeks after radical cystectomy was 21.95% (case) and 
27.27% (control), with no significant difference between the two groups. 
However, when the catheter was removed 2 weeks after surgery, the catheter tip 
culture test revealed significant bacterial colonies in 25 (60.98%) and 38 
(86.36%) patients in the case and control group, respectively. No 
catheter-related postoperative side effects were observed in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CAUTIs in the two groups did not differ according 
to the catheter material. However, the catheter bacterial culture test showed 
that bacterial colonization was significantly suppressed on the Bi-Fi Free 
technology catheter, which comparatively inhibited biofilm formation.

BACKGROUND: Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction and ileal conduit 
diversion (ICD) can have different impacts on health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) in patients with bladder cancer.
PURPOSE: To conduct a meta-analysis to explore the comparison of HRQOL between 
ICD and ONB in women.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for available 
papers published from inception up to December 2020. The outcomes were the score 
data from HRQOL questionnaires. The random-effects model was used for all 
analyses.
RESULTS: Four studies (six datasets; 283 patients) were included. In the 
EORTC-QLQ-C30, there were no differences between ICD and ONB regarding cognitive 
functioning (weighted mean difference (WMD)=1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
-20.52,22.88, P=0.915), global health (WMD=1.98, 95%CI: -15.26,19.22, P=0.822), 
emotional functioning (WMD=0.86, 95%CI: -19.62,21.33, P=0.935), physical 
functioning (WMD=0.94, 95%CI: -11.61,13.49, P=0.883), role functioning 
(WMD=-4.94, 95%CI: -12.15,2.27, P=0.180), and social functioning (WMD=-4.71, 
95%CI: -20.83,11.40, P=0.567). There were no differences between ONB and ICD for 
specific symptoms (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain) and single items 
(dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial 
difficulties) (all P>0.05). In EORTC-QLQ-BLM30, there were no differences 
between ICD and ONB regarding bowel symptoms (WMD=5.45, 95%CI: -15.30,26.20, 
P=0.607), body image (WMD=-13.12, 95%CI: -31.15,4.92, P=0.154), sexual 
functioning (WMD=-5.55, 95%CI: -14.96,3.85, P=0.247), and urinary symptom 
(WMD=5.50, 95%CI: -7.34,18.34, P=0.401), but one study reported better future 
perspective with ONB (WMD=-14.9, 95%CI: -27.14,-2.66, P=0.017).
CONCLUSION: Women who underwent ONB do not appear to have a statistically 
significantly better HRQOL than women who underwent ICD, based on EORTC-QLQ-C30 
and EORTC-QLQ-BML30.

Background The two commonly used methods for uretero-ileal anastomosis (UIA) 
during radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are the 
Bricker and Wallace 1 techniques. Published data on the incidence of strictures 
at anastomotic sites is limited. This study compares both anastomotic techniques 
in terms of uretero-ileal stricture (UIS) rates and the factors that govern it 
in the patient group. Material and methods Records of all patients presenting 
with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy at the department of 
uro-oncology, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre 
(SKMCH&RC) Lahore, Pakistan, from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018, were 
reviewed retrospectively, and all adult patients aged >18 years out of them were 
selected for the study. Results With a total of 116 patients, the mean age was 
54.37 ± 11.16 and a male majority (83.6%). Urinary diversion using ileal conduit 
was performed in 70 (60.3%) patients and the rest of them i.e. 46 (39.7%) had 
neobladder formation. Amongst them, uretero-ileal anastomosis was constructed 
via Bricker and Wallace 1 in 73 (62.9%) patients and 43 (37.1%) patients 
respectively. Pelvic radiotherapy was received by 13 (11.2%) patients. 
Anastomotic stricture developed in 19 (16.4%) cases. A relatively similar 
proportion of stricture rate was found in Bricker and Wallace 1 technique (10% 
vs 13%). Body mass index (BMI) was found to be significantly higher in patients 
who developed UIS. Incidence of stricture formation was more on the left than 
right side i.e. 12 (63.2%) vs five (26.3%) while two (10.5%) patients developed 
bilateral strictures. Conclusion No significant difference in stricture 
formation was noted between Bricker and Wallace 1 technique. High BMI and 
anastomotic leaks were the contributory factors for this complication during our 
experience.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion by ileal conduit 
(IC) or ileal orthotopic neobladder (ONB) is the standard-of-care for surgical 
treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Yet, it is unclear how urinary 
diversion affects the patient's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the 
longer-term.
METHODS: HRQOL was assessed preoperatively, 3mo postoperatively and then 
annually until a maximum follow-up of 48 months using the validated EORTC 
QLQ-C30- as well as the bladder cancer-specific FACT-BL- and 
QLQ-BLM30-questionnaires. A propensity-score matching for the variables "age," 
"ASA-classification," "cardiovascular co-morbidity," "sex" as well as "tumor 
stage," and "preoperative physical functioning score" was performed. 
Hypothetical predictors for decreased general HRQOL were analyzed using 
multivariable logistic regression models.
RESULTS: After propensity-score matching, 246 patients were analyzed. HRQOL 
assessment revealed significant differences regarding preoperative QLQ-C30 
symptoms which diminished during the postoperative time course. Similarly, we 
did not find significant differences based on bladder cancer-specific FACT-BL 
and QLQ-BLM HRQOL assessment including body image (48 months: 29.6.4 [IC] vs. 
40.7 [ONB]; P = .733). Regarding general HRQOL, we found increased global health 
status scores for ONB throughout the whole observational period without reaching 
statistical significance (48 months: 55.0 [IC] vs. 70.1 [ONB]; P = .079). In 
multivariate analysis, cardiovascular comorbidity was an independent predictor 
of impaired HRQOL 24 months (HR 2.20; CI95% 1.02-5.72, P = .044) and 36 months 
(HR 6.84; CI95% 1.61-29.14, P = .009) postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: We did not observe significant differences in bladder-specific as 
well as generic HRQOL in the longer-term and consequently, the type of urinary 
diversion was not an independent predictor of good general HRQOL in a follow-up 
period of 4 years.

BACKGROUND: Impaired cognitive function of bladder cancer patients plays a role 
in coping with the kind of urinary diversion and may impact perioperative 
morbidity. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the prevalence of mild 
cognitive impairment in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Secondary 
objectives included correlation of common cognition tests, assessment of the 
admitting physician, and perioperative complication rates.
METHODS: Patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer were 
prospectively screened by neuropsychological tests including cognition tests 
[DemTect (Dementia Detection test), MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), clock 
drawing test] prior to surgery. Besides, clinical characteristics and 
perioperative outcomes were documented. Frequency of mild cognitive impairment 
as assessed by DemTect was correlated with the results of MMSE and clock drawing 
test, the occurrence of anxiety and depression, the assessment of the admitting 
physician, and perioperative complication rates as calculated by Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient. Comparative analysis (parametric and nonparametric) of 
patient characteristics (nonpathological versus pathological DemTect suggestive 
of mild cognitive impairment) was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients (80% male, median age 69 years) were analyzed. 
DemTect was suspicious of mild cognitive impairment in 27% (14/51) of patients, 
whereas MMSE and clock drawing test showed pathological results only in 10/51 
and 6/51 patients, respectively. We found no correlation between mild cognitive 
impairment and anxiety/depression status. In all, 5/20 patients (25%) with 
suspicious DemTect results were considered suitable for a continent diversion 
neobladder by the admitting physician. Suspicious DemTect results were 
predictive for higher perioperative complication rates (29% versus 5%). Study 
limitations include small sample size and missing long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild cognitive impairment was observed in more than a quarter of 
radical cystectomy patients prior to surgery. Preoperative assessment should be 
supplemented by neuropsychological testing such as the DemTect as mild cognitive 
impairment is often underestimated and associated with significantly higher 
perioperative complication rates.

CONTEXT: Surveillance of the urethra and management of urethral recurrence (UR) 
after radical cystectomy (RC) is an area with poor evidence.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to summarize the available evidence and provide clinicians 
with practical recommendations on how to prevent and manage UR after RC for 
bladder cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched during 
September 2021 for studies evaluating UR after RC. The primary endpoint was 
oncologic outcomes for patients who experienced UR depending on different 
surveillance and management approaches.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Forty-three studies were included in the quantitative 
synthesis. According to the currently available literature, a tight-knitted 
surveillance protocol should be implemented for males treated with RC and 
nonorthotopic neobladder diversion as well as patients with prostatic 
involvement, tumor multifocality, bladder neck involvement, and concomitant 
carcinoma in situ. A survival benefit of a prophylactic urethrectomy has been 
reported only in patients at very high risk for UR based on clinical factors. 
Surveillance protocols were highly heterogeneous and poorly documented among 
included studies. Patients whose UR was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms had 
a poor prognosis. Only limited data were available on the comparative 
effectiveness of watchful waiting after RC versus clinical symptom screening as 
part of a follow-up strategy. However, the use of regular cytology and/or 
urethroscopy seems useful in select patients at high risk for UR. Despite 
limited data on the optimal management of UR, urethra-sparing approaches 
(transurethral resection of UR) seem to be an option for Ta (only) recurrences; 
a salvage urethrectomy with or without chemotherapy should be the standard for 
all others.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the currently available literature, we have proposed an 
algorithm to guide the decision-making process to help identify and treat UR 
after RC. Given the lack of evidence on how to deal with UR and surveil patients 
at risk for UR, this study may invigorate research in this area of unmet need.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Early diagnosis and tailored management of urethral recurrence 
could help improve oncologic outcomes in these patients.

BACKGROUND: To investigate whether Pentafecta is suitable for bladder cancer 
patients receiving laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC).
METHODS: From November 2013 to December 2020, muscle invasive Bladder Cancer 
(MIBC) and non-muscle invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) patients who received LRC 
and urinary diversion were retrospectively analyzed. Pentafecta was defined as 
meeting five criteria: negative soft margin, ≥ 16 lymph nodes (LNs) removed, 
major complications free, urinary diversion related sequelae free and clinical 
recurrence free within 1 year. Analyze the achievement of five criteria and 
compare the overall survival (OS) of Pentafecta group with non-attainment group. 
Multivariable Cox's regression was performed to evaluate the impact of 
Pentafecta on OS. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to explore the 
effect of surgical experience on Pentafecta attainment.
RESULTS: A total of 340 patients were included, negative soft margin, ≥ 16 lymph 
nodes (LNs) removed, major complications free, urinary diversion related 
sequelae free and clinical recurrence free within 1 year were observed in 95.3%, 
30.3%, 83.8%, 75.0% and 85.6% of patients, respectively. Pentafecta group had a 
significantly longer OS than the non-attainment group (P = 0.027). The group 
with 10-15 LNs removed and meeting the other four criteria had a similar OS to 
group with ≥ 16 LNs removed (Pentafecta group) (5-year OS: 67.3% vs 72.7%, 
P = 0.861). Pentafecta (HR = 0.33, P = 0.011), positive lymph nodes (HR = 2.08, 
P = 0.028) and MIBC (HR = 3.70, P < 0.001) were all significant predictors of OS 
in multivariable Cox's regression. Surgical experience (OR = 1.05, P < 0.001), 
conduit (OR = 2.09, P = 0.047) and neobladder (OR = 2.47, P = 0.048) were all 
independent predictors of Pentafecta attainment in multivariable logistic 
regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Pentafecta is suitable for bladder cancer patients receiving LRC 
and has the potential to be a valuable tool for evaluating the quality of LRC. 
Based on Pentafecta analysis, removing 10 LNs instead of 16 LNs as the one of 
the five criteria may be more appropriate for bladder cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy (RC) remains the gold standard for the 
treatment of recurrent high-risk non-muscle-infiltrating bladder cancer (BC) and 
muscle-infiltrating BC. Currently, there is no uniform standardized procedure 
for laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC).
AIM: To share our initial experience with the three layers with three-port 
approach for laparoscopic radical cystectomy (TLTPA-LRC) and to investigate its 
safety and effectiveness.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April 2017 and March 2020, 32 patients with 
bladder tumors underwent TLTPA-LRC, pelvic lymph node dissection, and 
extracorporeal construction of the Studer neobladder. The basic characteristics 
of the patients, clinical pathology, and perioperative and follow-up data were 
analyzed. We also describe our step-by-step surgical technique for TLTPA-LRC.
RESULTS: The median operation time was 278.5 min (range: 221-346 min), and the 
mean estimated blood loss was 233.4 ml (102-445 ml). The rates of intraoperative 
blood transfusion and postoperative transportation to the intensive care unit 
after surgery were 12.5% and 100%, respectively. Postoperative pathology showed 
7 cases of T1, 20 cases of T2, and 5 cases of T3. Lymph node dissection and 
surgical margins were both negative. During a median follow-up of 13.5 months, 4 
patients had early complications (< 30 days) and no patients had major 
complications (grade ≥ 3). The patients are now alive without local metastasis 
and with satisfactory urinary control ability day and night.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the TLTPA-LRC approach requires a certain level of 
surgical proficiency, it is feasible and serves as a minimally invasive method 
for selected patients.

BACKGROUND: It has been shown that baseline health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) is a valuable prognostic indicator of survival outcomes for various 
metastatic cancers, but there is no evidence on the prognostic value of baseline 
HRQOL for patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) and 
ileal conduit (IC) or orthotopic ileal neobladder (ONB) with curative intent.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between baseline HRQOL and survival 
outcomes following RC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included 407 patients with 
prospectively assessed baseline HRQOL before RC. Patients were stratified 
according to the Global Health Status (GHS) domain of the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire, with good general 
HRQOL defined as GHS ≥70 on the basis of validated cutoff levels. A propensity 
score-matched analysis of 357 patients (1:2 ratio; 125 patients with GHS ≥70 vs 
232 with GHS <70) was performed.
INTERVENTION: RC with IC or ONB.
OUTCOME MEASURES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was 
cancer-specific survival (CSS). The secondary endpoints were overall survival 
(OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox 
regression models were constructed to assess the prognostic value of baseline 
GHS for prediction of survival outcomes.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Median follow-up was 40.5 mo. The rates of 5-yr CSS 
(82% vs 65%; p = 0.001), 5-yr OS (76% vs 53%; p = 0.001), and 5-yr RFS (50% vs 
39%; p = 0.04) were significantly higher in the GHS ≥70 cohort. GHS ≥70 was 
confirmed as an independent predictor for CSS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.18-0.73; p = 0.004), OS (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.79; p 
= 0.005), and RFS (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.83; p = 0.008) in multivariate 
analyses. Study limitations include the retrospective analysis of prospectively 
collected data and use of a HRQOL questionnaire not specifically for bladder 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that preoperative baseline HRQOL has 
significant predictive value for outcomes of RC with curative intent for bladder 
cancer. We found that good general HRQOL at baseline accurately predicts greater 
CSS, OS, and RFS.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We assessed the association between health-related quality of 
life at baseline and survival outcomes after radical cystectomy for bladder 
cancer. We found that good general health-related quality of life at baseline 
predicts better survival outcomes and that higher baseline scores were 
associated with greater cancer-specific survival.

BACKGROUND: The effect of ERAS protocols in a population of radical cystectomy 
(RC) patients fit for neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been specifically 
explored.
OBJECTIVE: To compare perioperative outcomes of open RC according to the 
application of an ERAS protocol in a population of patients treated by 
cisplatin-based NAC.
METHODS: All consecutive patients treated by NAC and RC between 2016 and 2019 
were included. The ERAS pathway was implemented in June 2018 and followed the 
EAU recommendations. All data were prospectively collected. Patients' 
characteristics, operative outcomes, length of stay (LOS), complication rate 
according to Clavien-Dindo and pathological results were compared between pre- 
and post-ERAS. Statistical analysis was performed using R.
RESULTS: In total, 79 patients were included, 29 in the ERAS group and 50 in the 
non-ERAS group. A median number of 19 out of 22 ERAS criteria were followed. 
Mean number of NAC cycles was 4.45 vs. 4.79 in the pre- and post-ERAS groups 
respectively (P=0.24). Median time between NAC and RC was 3.8months. 
Thirty-eight percent vs. 48% of patients received an ileal neobladder in the 
pre- and post-ERAS group respectively (P=0.51). No differences were observed 
regarding operative time, blood loss or operative transfusion rates. LOS was 
drastically reduced in the ERAS period (18.94 vs. 12.10days, P<0.001) as well as 
major (>Clavien 2) complications rate (65% vs. 28%, P=0.004).
CONCLUSION: ERAS drastically reduced the LOS and the rate of high-grade 
complications and can be effectively applied to patients receiving NAC without 
delaying RC.

INTRODUCTION: Prophylactic urethrectomy is often performed simultaneously with 
radical cystectomy (RC) in patients who are not selected for neobladder creation 
for urinary diversion. However, the indications for prophylactic urethrectomy 
are still controversial. Here, we introduce the ideal urethral dissection 
technique during robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in patients without 
simultaneous prophylactic urethrectomy.
MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: At our hospital, RARC is performed using a da 
Vinci surgical system with the operating table tilted to 20°. After lymph node 
dissection and bladder mobilization, periurethral dissection is commenced. A 
notable point of our technique is en bloc resection of the bladder and 
membranous urethra using a continuous intracorporeal approach. First, while 
applying traction on the isolated bladder in the cranial direction, we carefully 
and gradually dissect the urethral smooth muscle from the external urethral 
sphincter with electrocautery scissors. Next, we ligate the membranous urethra 
with suture material as far from the prostate as possible. Then, we cut the 
urethra as far from the prostate as possible after ligation of the urethra with 
a Hem-o-lok clip just beyond the apex of the prostate. Using this method, we are 
able to remove at least 1.0 cm of the membranous urethra en bloc with the 
bladder. Finally, we suture the pelvic floor, including the levator ani muscle, 
in two layers using 3-0 V-Loc and 2-0 V-Loc sutures.
DISCUSSION: We believe this technique allows separation of the residual urethra 
from the abdominal cavity and enables safe performance of secondary 
urethrectomy.

Background and Objective: The Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) only reports 
the postoperative complication of highest grade. It is thus of limited value for 
radical cystectomy, after which patients usually experience multiple 
complications. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) is a novel scoring 
system, which incorporates all postoperative events in one single value. The 
study aimed to adopt the CCI for the evaluation of complications in patients 
undergoing robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary 
diversion (ICUD) and explore its advantages in the analysis of the morbidity of 
RARC with ICUD. Patients and Methods: A multicentric cohort of 959 patients 
undergoing RARC+ICUD between 2015 and 2020, whose complications are encoded in 
local prospective registries. Postoperative complications at 30 days were 
assessed using both the CDC and CCI. The CCI was calculated using an online tool 
(assessurgery.com). Risk factors for overall, major complications (CDC ≥III), 
and CCI were evaluated using uni- and multivariable logistic and linear 
regressions. To analyze the potential advantage of using the CCI in clinical 
trials, a sample size calculation of a hypothetic clinical trial was performed 
using as endpoint reduction of morbidity with either the CDC or CCI. Results: 
Overall, 885 postoperative complications were reported in 507 patients (53%). 
The CCI improved the definition of postoperative morbidity in 22.6% of patients. 
Male sex and neobladder were associated with major complications and to a 
significant increase in CCI on adjusted regressions. In a hypothetical clinical 
trial, 80 patients would be needed to demonstrate a ten-point reduction in CCI, 
compared with 186 needed to demonstrate an absolute risk reduction of 20% in 
overall morbidity using the CDC. Conclusion: CCI improves the evaluation of 
postoperative morbidity by considering the cumulative aspect of complications 
compared with the CDC. Implementing the CCI for radical cystectomy would help 
reducing sample sizes in clinical trials. Clinical Trial Registration number: 
NCT03049410.

Uretero-enteric anastomotic strictures (UES) after robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) represent the main cause of post-operative renal dysfunction. 
The gold standard for treatment of UES is open uretero-ileal reimplantation 
(UIR), which is often a challenging and complex procedure associated with 
significant morbidity. We report a challenging case of long severe bilateral UES 
(5 cm on the left side, 3 cm on the right side) after RARC in a 55 years old 
male patient who was previously treated in another institution and who came to 
our attention with kidney dysfunction and bilateral ureteral stents from the 
previous two years. Difficult multiple ureteral stent placement and 
substitutions had been previously performed in another hospital, with resulting 
urinary leakage. An open surgical procedure via an anterior transperitoneal 
approach was performed at our hospital, which took 10 h to complete, given the 
massive intestinal and periureteral adhesions, which required very meticulous 
dissection. A vascular surgeon was called to repair an accidental rupture that 
had occurred during the dissection of the external left iliac artery, involved 
in the extensive periureteral inflammatory process. Excision of a segment of the 
external iliac artery was accomplished, and an interposition graft using a 
reversed saphenous vein was performed. Bilateral ureteroneocystostomy followed, 
which required, on the left side, the interposition of a Casati-Boari flap 
harvested from the neobladder, and on the right side a neobladder-psoas-hitching 
procedure with intramucosal direct ureteral reimplantation. The patient 
recovered well and is currently in good health, as determined at his recent 
24-month follow-up visit. No signs of relapse of the strictures or other 
complications were detected. Bilateral ureteral reimplantation after robotic 
radical cystectomy is a complex procedure that should be restricted to 
high-volume centers, where multidisciplinary teams are available, including 
urologists, endourologists, and general and vascular surgeons.

A 62-year-old man was referred to our department for artificial urinary 
sphincter (AUS) implantation as treatment for total incontinence after 
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Preoperative cystoscopy revealed bladder 
tumor that was proven to be high-grade micropapillary urothelial carcinoma by 
transurethral resection. We performed radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder 
reconstruction, followed by AUS implantation to treat incontinence. The AUS 
implantation procedure was performed 5 months after total cystectomy and 
resulted in significant continence recovery. To date, AUS implantation after 
neobladder reconstruction has not been reported in Japan, although some case 
series have described this procedure overseas. In our view, AUS implantation is 
a useful therapeutic option for incontinence in patients undergoing neobladder 
reconstruction.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term renal function in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) Stage IIIa who underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic 
neobladder (RC/ONB) compared to matched controls.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using our Institutional Review Board-approved 
institutional database, patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 
45-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 who underwent RC/ONB were identified. A control group of 
patients with a GFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was selected. Groups were matched 
based on age, baseline hypertension/diabetes mellitus, perioperative 
chemotherapy, and preoperative hydronephrosis. A decrease in GFR of 
>10 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the follow-up was considered significant. A 
multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of GFR 
decline in each group.
RESULTS: Of 1237 patients who underwent RC/ONB, 508 patients were included (254 
per group). The mean preoperative GFR was 53.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the study group 
and 78.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in controls. The median follow-up was 3.7 years. During 
follow-up, GFR stayed at or above baseline in 51% of the study patients compared 
to 46% of the controls (P = 0.5). The mean time to a significant GFR decline in 
the study patients was significantly longer compared to the controls (5.6 vs 
2 years, respectively; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy was found to be the strongest predictor of a significant GFR 
decline as well as GFR decline below baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.29, P = 0.004; and HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.4-3.29, 
P < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Patients with CKD Stage IIIa who undergo ONB appear to have 
comparable long-term renal function to those with a GFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . 
An ONB reconstruction is a safe option for patients with CKD Stage IIIa desiring 
a continent diversion.

INTRODUCTION: Renal function impairment is often cited as a contraindication to 
continent diversion strategies. There is little evidence exploring renal 
function changes between continent and incontinent surgery in patients with 
preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD), in particular CKD3B.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of two high-volume centers performing 
robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with orthotopic neobladder (ONB) or 
ileal conduit (IC) between 2014 to 2020. Patients were stratified based on CKD 
estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) stage, which was estimated via the 
CKD-EPI equation. Postoperative renal function was compared for up to 60 months 
postoperative. Surgical, post-surgical, complications, and readmission data were 
gathered and compared between all patients RESULTS: 522 cystectomy patients, 430 
with IC and 125 with ONB, were included. eGFR decline was statistically 
significant in a matched cohort of IC and ONB patients only at 3 months. There 
were no statistically significant differences between readmission rates, time to 
readmission, or complications. 34.6% of stage 3B patients had hydronephrosis on 
imaging prior to surgery, compared to 11.4%, 22.1% and 21.8% of CKD stage 1, 2, 
and 3A patients. CKD stage 3B had statistically and clinically improved eGFR 
through 24 months.
CONCLUSION: ONB surgery may be a viable diversion strategy in patients 
previously thought to be contraindicated due to low renal function.

BACKGROUND: Open revision of ureteroenteric strictures (UESs) is associated with 
considerable morbidity. There is a lack of data evaluating the feasibility of 
robotic revisions.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the perioperative and functional outcomes of 
robot-assisted ureteroenteric reimplantation (RUER) for the management of UESs 
after radical cystectomy (RC).
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective multicenter study of 61 
patients, who underwent 63 RUERs at seven high-volume institutions between 2009 
and 2020 for benign UESs after RC, was conducted.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were reviewed for 
demographics, stricture characteristics, and perioperative outcomes. Variables 
associated with being stricture free after an RUER were evaluated using a 
multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 63 RUERs, 22 were right sided (35%), 34 left 
sided (54%), and seven bilateral (11%). Twenty-seven (44%) had prior 
abdominal/pelvic surgery and five (8%) radiotherapy (RT). Thirty-two patients 
had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores I-II (52%) and 29 ASA III 
(48%). Forty-two (68%) RUERs were in ileal conduits, 18 (29%) in neobladders, 
and two (3%) in Indiana pouch. The median time to diagnosis of a UES from 
cystectomy was 5 (3-11) mo. Of the UESs, 28 (44%) failed an endourological 
attempt (balloon dilatation/endoureterotomy). The median RUER operative time was 
195 (175-269) min. No intraoperative complications or conversions to open 
approach were reported. Twenty-three (37%) patients had postoperative 
complications (20 [32%] were minor and three [5%] major). The median length of 
hospital stay was 3 (1-6) d and readmissions were 5%. After a median follow-up 
of 19 (8-43) mo, 84% of cases were stricture free. Lack of prior RT was the only 
variable associated with better stricture-free survival after RUER (hazard ratio 
6.8, 95% confidence interval 1.10-42.00, p = 0.037). The study limitations 
include its retrospective nature and the small number of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: RUER is a feasible procedure for the management of UESs. 
Prospective and larger studies are warranted to prove the safety and efficacy of 
this technique.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a novel 
minimally invasive technique for the management of ureteroenteric strictures. We 
conclude that robotic reimplantation is a feasible and effective procedure.

BACKGROUND: For females undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion, decreases 
in sexual and urinary functions can have a significant impact on quality of 
life. Pelvic organ-preserving (POP) radical cystectomy (RC) has been proposed as 
an approach to improve postoperative functional outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative functional outcomes of a robotic approach 
for female POP RC with intracorporeal urinary diversion.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter retrospective study 
evaluating sexual, urinary, and oncological outcomes for sexually active females 
undergoing POP robot-assisted RC for ≤T2 bladder cancer. Exclusion criteria 
included multifocal, trigonal, or locally advanced tumors.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: We describe a step-by-step technique for POP robot-assisted 
RC with intracorporeal urinary diversion.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome of the study was evaluation of sexual and 
urinary functions following surgery. Oncological outcomes were evaluated as a 
secondary endpoint.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Our study included 23 females who underwent POP 
robot-assisted RC between 2008 and 2020 with intracorporeal neobladder (87%) or 
ileal conduit (13%) reconstruction. The median follow-up was 20 mo. A 
postoperative sexual function questionnaire was completed by 15 patients (65%). 
Of those, 13 (87%) resumed sexual activity at a median of 6 mo after surgery. Of 
the patients with a neobladder, 14 (70%) achieved daytime continence and 16 
(80%) achieved nighttime continence. Cancer-specific and overall survival were 
both 91%. The results are limited by their retrospective nature.
CONCLUSIONS: POP robot-assisted RC with orthotopic neobladder allows a majority 
of female patients to return to sexual activity after surgery. This approach 
should be considered for selected sexually active women.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We evaluated 23 women with bladder cancer who underwent 
surgical removal of the bladder with preservation of their reproductive organs. 
Following this surgery, a majority of patients resumed sexual activity. For 
selected patients, this technique can be performed without compromising cancer 
control.

OBJECTIVE: To begin to understand how to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
after an innovative operation termed intracorporeal laparoscopic reconstruction 
of detenial sigmoid neobladder, we explored the factors that influence DVT 
following surgery, with the aim of constructing a model for predicting DVT 
occurrence.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 151 bladder cancer patients who 
underwent intracorporeal laparoscopic reconstruction of detenial sigmoid 
neobladder. Data describing general clinical characteristics and other common 
parameters were collected and analyzed. Thereafter, we generated model 
evaluation curves and finally cross-validated their extrapolations.
RESULTS: Age and body mass index were risk factors for DVT, whereas 
postoperative use of hemostatic agents and postoperative passive muscle massage 
were significant protective factors. Model evaluation curves showed that the 
model had high accuracy and little bias. Cross-validation affirmed the accuracy 
of our model.
CONCLUSION: The prediction model constructed herein was highly accurate and had 
little bias; thus, it can be used to predict the likelihood of developing DVT 
after surgery.

Introduction: Recent studies employing functional imaging methodology have 
revealed reference brain regions of urinary tract function, namely, the midbrain 
periaqueductal gray matter, thalamus, and cingulate and prefrontal cortices. The 
orthotopic ileal neobladder is a desirable method for urinary diversion after 
radical cystectomy, but its supraspinal control remains unknown. We aimed to 
evaluate brain activity while maintaining urinary urgency and voluntary urinary 
control in male subjects with ileal orthotopic neobladders by performing 
functional MRI (fMRI) during a block design experiment. Materials and Methods: 
Patients were recruited at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of the Sun Yat-sen 
University from October 2017 to May 2019. Two tasks were performed during fMRI 
scanning: (1) repeated infusion and withdrawal of sterile saline solution into 
and out of the neobladder to simulate urgency; and (2) repeated contraction of 
the pelvic floor muscle with a full neobladder to induce inhibition of 
micturition since the subjects were asked not to urinate. The obtained data were 
visualized and statistically analyzed. Results: Sixteen subjects were recruited 
in the study, and data were obtained from 10 subjects: mean age 60.1 years, 
average postoperative time 20.2 months, and daytime continence rate 100%. The 
parahippocampus, frontal lobe, vermis, and anterior cingulate cortex were 
activated with large bladder volumes, and the thalamus and caudate nucleus were 
deactivated during voluntary urinary control. Conclusion: A complex supraspinal 
program is involved during ileal orthotopic neobladder control, which is 
significantly different from that with normal bladders, in which the original 
intestine visceral volume sensation is preserved.

Urinary diversion following radical cystectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy is 
the gold standard for the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Urinary 
diversions are at an increased risk of urolithiasis as a result of various 
factors. Traditional surgical intervention has included open cystolithotomy 
which has given way to minimally invasive techniques as of late. We describe a 
case of a robotic-assisted cystolithotomy from a neobladder in a 54-year-old 
female patient with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is the first 
description of a robotic-assisted removal of a stone in an orthotopic 
neobladder. This approach has many advantages, especially in the removal of 
larger stones. Further study is needed to investigate the efficacy and success 
of this approach.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy is one of the most complex operations in 
urology, in which orthotopic ileal neobladder construction is an important part. 
With the development of laparoscopic instruments and surgical techniques, 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy has been shown to be feasible and safe and has 
obvious benefits. However, intracorporeal laparoscopic U-shaped ileal neobladder 
construction with three ports is rarely reported.
AIM: To share our experience in intracorporeal laparoscopic U-shaped ileal 
neobladder construction with three ports in patients with bladder cancer and 
explore the feasibility, safety and benefits of this procedure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019, 32 patients with 
bladder cancer underwent laparoscopic intracorporeal radical cystectomy and 
orthotopic neobladder. In this article, complete intracorporeal U-shaped ileal 
neobladder construction with three ports will be presented.
RESULTS: The median estimated intraoperative blood loss was 130 ml. The median 
total operative time was 270 min, and ileal reservoir construction and 
anastomosis required 93 min. The median time to recovery of intestinal function 
following the operation was 3 days. At a median follow-up of 13 months, 8 
patients had hydronephrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracorporeal laparoscopic U-shaped ileal neobladder construction 
with three ports is feasible and safe. This procedure is less invasive and is 
highly beneficial for patients with difficulty with anastomosis of the ileum and 
urethra due to high mesenteric tension.

OBJECTIVES: To describe our robotic Y intracorporeal neobladder (ICNB) technique 
and to report its post-operative complications and urodynamics (UD) findings.
SUBJECTS: and Methods: In this prospective study we enrolled patients affected 
by MIBC (T1-T4N0-N1M0) from 01/2017 to 06/2021 at our Centers. All the patients 
underwent robotic radical cystectomy (RARC) with Y-ICNB reconfiguration. Early 
and late complications were collected and classified according to Clavien-Dindo. 
Continence and potency at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were evaluated. At the 3rd month 
of follow-up patients underwent UD. Finally, in a retrospective match paired 
analysis the functional outcomes of Y RARC patients were compared with a cohort 
of open Y radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: 45 patients were enrolled. Overall 30-day complications were observed 
in 25 (55,5%) patients and 30 to 90-days complications in 4 (8,9%). 9 patients 
(20%) had Clavien ≥3 complications. UDs revealed median neobladder capacity of 
268 cc, with a median compliance of 13 ml/cm H20; the voiding phase showed a 
voiding volume and a post void residual (PVR) of 154 cc and 105 cc respectively. 
At 12 months of follow-up 4.4%, 15.5% and 4.4% of the patients experienced urge, 
stress and mix urinary incontinence respectively. The comparison between Y RARC 
and Y open RC revealed a higher neobladder capacity with open approach 
(p = 0.049) with subsequent better findings during the voiding phase in terms of 
maximum flow (p = 0.002), voiding volume (p = 0.001) and PVR (p = 0.01). 
Focusing on continence recovery, a slight trend in favor of RARC was shown 
without reaching the statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic Y-ICNB is feasible and safe as shown by the low rate of 
postoperative complications. Satisfying UD functional outcomes are achievable, 
both during filling and voiding phase.

(1) Aim: Robot assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intacorporeal neobladder 
(iN) is a challenging procedure. There is a paucity of reports on RARC-iN, the 
extracorporeal approach being the most used. The aim of our study was to assess 
the learning curve of RARC-iN and to test its performance in benchmarking 
Pasadena consensus outcomes. (2) Material and methods: The single-institution 
learning curve of RARC-iN was retrospectively evaluated. Demographic, clinical 
and pathologic data of all patients were recorded. Indications to radical 
cystectomy included muscle invasive bladder cancer (pT ≥ 2) or recurrent high 
grade non muscle invasive bladder cancer. The cumulative sum (CUSUM) technique, 
one of the methods developed to monitor the performance and quality of the 
industrial sector, was adopted by the medical field in the 1970s to analyze 
learning curves for surgical procedures. The learning curve was evaluated using 
the following criteria: 1. operative time (OT) <5 h; 2. 24-h Hemoglobin (Hb) 
drop <2 g/dl; 3. severe complications (according to the Clavien classification 
system) <30%; 4. positive surgical margins <5%; and 5. complete lymph-node 
dissection defined as more than 16 nodes. Benchmarking of all five items on 
quintile analysis was tested, and a failure rate <20% for any outcome was set as 
threshold. (3) Results: the first 100 consecutive RARC-iN patients were included 
in the analysis. At CUSUM analysis, RARC required 20 cases to achieve a plateau 
in terms of operative time (defined as more than 3 consecutive procedures below 
300 min). Hemoglobin drop, PSM and number of removed lymph-nodes did not change 
significantly along the learning curve. Overall, 41% of the patients presented 
at least one complication. Low-grade and high-grade complication rates were 30% 
and 17%, respectively. When assessing the benchmarks of all five Pasadena 
consensus outcomes on quintile analysis, a plateau was achieved after the first 
60 cases. (4) Conclusions: RARC-iN is a challenging procedure. The potential 
impact of the learning curve on significant outcomes, such as high grade 
complications and positive surgical margins, has played a detrimental effect on 
its widespread adoption. According to this study, in tertiary referral centers, 
60 procedures are sufficient to benchmark all outcomes defined in Pasadena RARC 
consensus.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is as safe and more cost-effective than haemodialysis 
(HD). It also allows patients to undergo renal replacement therapy (RRT) from 
home. However, PD remains underutilised in many parts of the world. This is true 
in part because of many perceived relative contraindications to PD, including a 
history of prior major abdominal surgery. Prior major abdominal surgery is a 
concern for standard bedside or surgical catheter placement since these patients 
are at risk of having adhesions, which can complicate catheter placement. 
However, with laparoscopic advancements, prior major abdominal surgery is no 
longer even a relative contraindication to PD for skilled and experienced 
surgeons. We report the case of a male in his 70s with a history of 
cystoprostatectomy which was curative for a muscle invasive bladder carcinoma 5 
years prior to his RRT. The patient had longstanding chronic kidney disease 
which worsened gradually. After receiving RRT education, the patient favoured 
PD. The catheter was placed despite the surgeon noting abdominal adhesions and 
the patient successfully underwent 12 months of PD which had a positive impact 
on his quality of life. He transferred to HD after contracting a complex 
PD-associated peritonitis. Thus, new research should be conducted to better 
understand the real impact of prior abdominal surgeries as a contraindication to 
PD, especially in centres where the surgeons have experience with advanced 
laparoscopy.

BACKGROUND: High-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) has a poor 
prognosis. Old trials showed that external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after 
radical cystectomy (RC) decreases the incidence of local recurrences but induces 
severe toxicity.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the toxicity and local control rate after adjuvant EBRT 
after RC delivered with volumetric arc radiotherapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a multicentric phase 2 trial. From 
August 2014 till October 2020, we treated 72 high-risk MIBC patients with 
adjuvant EBRT after RC. High-risk MIBC is defined as ≥pT3-MIBC ± lymphovascular 
invasion, fewer than ten lymph nodes removed, pathological positive lymph nodes, 
or positive surgical margins.
INTERVENTION: Patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions with intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy to the pelvic lymph nodes ± cystectomy bed.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome is acute 
toxicity. We report on local relapse-free rate (LRFR), clinical relapse-free 
survival (CRFS), overall survival (OS), and bladder cancer-specific survival 
(BCSS).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median follow-up is 18 mo. Forty-two patients (61%) 
developed acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Four patients (6%) had 
acute grade 3 GI toxicity. One patient had grade 5 diarrhea and vomiting due to 
obstruction at 1 mo. Two-year probabilities of developing grade ≥3 and ≥2 GI 
toxicity were 17% and 76%, respectively. Urinary toxicity, assessed in 17 
patients with a neobladder, was acceptable with acute grade 2 and 3 urinary 
toxicity reported in 53% (N = 9) and 18% (N = 3) of the patients, respectively. 
The 2-yr LRFR is 83% ± 5% and the 2-yr CRFS rate is 43% with a median CRFS time 
of 12 mo (95% confidence interval: 3-21 mo). Two-year OS and BCSS are 52% ± 7% 
and 62% ± 7%, respectively. Shortcomings are the nonrandomized study design and 
limited follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant EBRT after RC can be administered without excessive severe 
toxicity.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at the incidence of toxicity and 
local control after adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following radical 
cystectomy (RC) in high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. We found 
that adjuvant EBRT was feasible and resulted in good local control. We conclude 
that these data support further enrollment of patients in ongoing trials to 
evaluate the place of adjuvant EBRT after RC.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and location of lower extremity deep vein 
thrombosis in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.
METHODS: We performed radical cystectomy in 137 patients with bladder cancer 
between August 2014 and February 2020. Since 2014, we have had a policy to 
screen for deep vein thrombosis using lower extremity ultrasonography both 
before and after radical cystectomy. We determined the incidence and location of 
deep vein thrombosis and classified it as either proximal or distal type. 
Furthermore, we explored the incidence of pulmonary embolism within 3 months 
after radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: After excluding six patients with a lack of ultrasonographic data, we 
evaluated 131 patients. Preoperative deep vein thrombosis (one proximal and 17 
distal) was diagnosed in 18 patients (14%) with no symptoms. Postoperative deep 
vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 41 patients (31%; three proximal and 38 
distal), of whom 26 (63%) had new-onset deep vein thrombosis after cystectomy. 
Three patients, two with proximal and one with distal type deep vein thrombosis, 
developed nonfatal pulmonary embolism postoperatively. Multivariate analysis 
showed that preoperative D-dimer levels (odds ratio 5.35, 95% confidence 
interval 1.74-16.50; P < 0.003), type of urinary diversion (ileal neobladder; 
odds ratio 11.15, 95% confidence interval 2.16-57.55; P = 0.004), and 
preoperative deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio 15.93, 95% confidence interval 
3.82-66.30; P < 0.001) were significant risk factors for postoperative deep vein 
thrombosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and post-radical cystectomy whole-leg ultrasonography can lead 
to an early perioperative diagnosis and immediate treatment of proximal deep 
vein thrombosis, thereby potentially preventing fatal pulmonary embolism.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the long-term effects of continent (neobladder) compared 
with incontinent (ileal conduit) urinary diversion.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of our departmental database. 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Chronic Kidney 
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Neobladder and ileal conduit 
patients were matched in a 1:2 ratio and a propensity score-matched analysis was 
carried out. Data were summarized using descriptive analysis. Trend plots were 
generated using baseline and follow-up creatinine values to compare estimated 
glomerular filtration rate at 3 months, then annually for 5 years. Variables 
associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed using 
multivariate linear analysis.
RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 137 patients (neobladder n = 50 and ileal 
conduit n = 87) with a median follow-up time of 3 years (interquartile range 
1-7 years). The ileal conduit group had shorter operative times (352 vs 444 min, 
P < 0.01), intracorporeal diversions were more common (66% vs 44%, P = 0.01), 
had prior abdominal surgery (66% vs 38%, P < 0.01) and had radiation (9% vs 0%, 
P = 0.03). The neobladder group more commonly had recurrent urinary tract 
infections (22% vs 3%, P < 0.01) and a steeper decrease in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate in the first year. On multivariate linear analysis, age/year 
(-0.59), body mass index per kg/m2 (-0.52), preoperative estimated glomerular 
filtration rate per unit (0.51), recurrent urinary tract infections (-14.03) and 
time versus day 90 (year 1, -7.52; year 2, -9.06; year 3, -10.78) were 
significantly associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate.
CONCLUSION: Ileal conduits and neobladders showed a similar effect on the 
estimated glomerular filtration rate up to 5 years after robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy. Recurrent urinary tract infections were associated with a worse 
estimated glomerular filtration rate.

BACKGROUND: Chronic urinary retention (CUR) is a frequent complication after 
orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction in women. To decrease CUR, several 
open surgical modifications to provide back support to the ONB have been 
established on the basis of pelvic anatomical differences between females and 
males.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate our technique for robotic intracorporeal 
reconfiguration of ONB as integrated into our open surgical approach to provide 
back support to the ONB with round ligaments in women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From November 2017 to April 2021, 28 patients 
underwent robotic intracorporeal ONB with a minimum of 6 mo of follow-up at a 
single centre.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: We performed robotic radical cystectomy, pelvic 
lymphadenectomy, and a complete intracorporeal ONB suspended with round 
ligaments (rONB). Our surgical procedure is demonstrated in the accompanying 
video.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographics and clinical and pathological data were collected. 
Perioperative and 90-d complications and 6-mo functional outcomes were compared 
for the rONB group (n = 12) and the patients receiving a traditional ONB (tONB; 
n = 16).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median total operative time was 305 min 
(interquartile range [IQR] 270-370) for tONB and 303 min (IQR 287-330) for rONB. 
The median estimated blood loss was 325 ml (IQR 200-700) for tONB and 350 ml 
(IQR 262-600) for rONB. Some 50% of the tONB group and 41.7% of the rONB group 
experienced low-grade complications. A total of 12.5% tONB and 8.3% rONB 
patients experienced high-grade complications with neobladder-vaginal fistula. 
The cumulative risk of CUR was 37.5% in the tONB group and 16.7% in the rONB 
group. This study is limited by the small sample size and the short follow-up 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: We established a feasible surgical technique for a robotic 
intracorporeal ONB configuration suspended with round ligaments. This may 
prevent the occurrence of emptying dysfunction in women.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We describe our stepwise technique for creating a new bladder 
within the body that is suspended with round ligaments. Patients undergoing 
removal of the bladder for bladder cancer may benefit from this technique in 
terms of better urinary function and the advantages of a robotic surgical 
approach.

INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
urinary diversion (ICUD) is a technically difficult procedure. Our aim was to 
evaluate the potential impact of the learning curve (LC) on perioperative and 
pathological outcomes of RARC with ICUD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients who 
underwent RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer between 2015-2020. We compared 3 
consecutive groups of 20 (G1), 20 (G2), and 22 (G3) patients to analyze the 
impact of the LC. G1 cases were performed by a senior surgeon experienced in 
robotic surgery, while G2-G3 were performed by 2 junior surgeons without 
experience under the mentorship of the senior surgeon.
RESULTS: The 3 groups had similar clinical and pathological characteristics. A 
total of 15 patients (24%) received a neobladder and 47 (75%) an ileal conduit. 
The mean operative time decreased 60 min between G1-G3 (p = 0.001). No 
conversions to open approach or intraoperative complications were reported. 
There were no differences between groups regarding positive margin rates 
(p = 0.6) or the number of lymph nodes removed (p = 0.061). The postoperative 
complication rate was 77% and did not change during the LC (p = 0.49). 
Uretero-enteric stricture rate decreased from 25% in G1 to 9% in G3 (p = 0.217).
CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of junior surgeons to a RARC with ICUD program after 
the initial 20 cases does not have an impact on the perioperative and 
pathological outcomes of the procedure. The operative time and the 
uretero-enteric stricture rate could be reduced during the LC.

To the Editor, Radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer is a life-changing 
surgery, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate. Ileal neobladder 
seems as an attractive way for urine management post cystectomy but would carry 
the risk of retaining urine in the ileal pouch for a long time, resulting in 
serum electrolyte changes, that may add to the patients' morbidity. EAU 
guidelines recommend against ileal neobladder for patients with liver and renal 
disorders, as well as for patients > 80 years old [...].

OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the impact on female quality of life and 
sexual function of orthotopic reconstruction after radical cystectomy for 
non-malignant bladder conditions. Radical cystectomy is commonly required to 
treat malignant conditions but may also be considered for the treatment of 
non-malignant diseases. These heterogeneous group of disorders includes 
interstitial cystitis, painful bladder syndrome, neurogenic bladder, 
haemorrhagic/ radiation cystitis, endometriosis and refractory genitourinary 
fistula. Treatment begins with non-invasive medical therapies but, in 
non-responder cases, a surgical solution should be considered. Such invasive 
techniques include urinary diversion and reconstructive procedures that have an 
impact on healthrelated quality of life, physical, social, and mental status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This narrative review research was done using the PubMed 
database up until 2020, July. All papers referring to cystectomy for benign 
indication were considered.
RESULTS: In comparison to other reconstructive options, orthotopic neobladder 
allows the restoration of a normal self-image and consequently it is the most 
suitable procedure when a surgical reconstruction is necessary for non-malignant 
conditions. However, women can face many disorders that impact on everyday life, 
such as voiding dysfunction or sexual activity problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Scant data is available about quality of life, sexual life and 
self-perception in women treated by cystectomy for benign conditions and most 
literature is dedicated to those indicators in cancer patients. More research is 
needed to understand the tolerability and the quality of life results of the 
female population affected by benign conditions undergoing this kind of surgical 
approach.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the reliability of technique selection strategy 
for ureteroileal anastomosis (Bricker vs. Wallace) by comparing perioperative 
outcomes, complications, and anastomotic stricture rate in a contemporary series 
of patients who underwent open radical cystectomy followed by reconstruction of 
modified Hautmann neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients underwent radical cystectomy and 
modified Hautmann neobladder, of whom 30 patients (group I) with Bricker 
anastomotic technique were compared to 30 matched paired patients with 
end-to-end ureteroileal anastomosis (group II). Long-term results, including 
ureteroileal stricture (UIS) and postoperative complication rate at two year 
follow up were available. The choice of anastomosis type was successively based 
on chimney size, ureteral length after retro-sigmoidal tunneling and diameter of 
distal ureter. Postoperative complications were graded according to the 
Clavien-Dindo system.
RESULTS: Ureteroileal stricture rate was 6.6% in group I vs. 0% in group II, 
after three months (p < 0.05), while anastomotic leakage rate was 6.6% vs. 3.3% 
(group I vs group II) between the two groups for the same follow up period (p > 
0.05). High-grade complications (Clavien III-V) were more in Bricker group as 
compared to Wallace group and the difference was significant (20% vs 10.3%, p = 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary outcomes demonstrate that this selection strategy 
seems to be clinically reliable, with lower incidence of postoperative 
complications in Wallace group.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the feasibility and safety of stentless 
uretero-intestinal anastomosis (UIA) during radical cystectomy (RC) with an 
ileal orthotopic neobladder.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 403 patients who underwent RC for bladder 
cancer between August 2014 and December 2018. The primary objective was to study 
the effect of stentless UIA on uretero-intestinal anastomosis stricture (UIAS), 
and the secondary objective was to evaluate the association between stentless 
UIA and other complications, including paralytic ileus, febrile urinary tract 
infection (UTI), and urine leakage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to 
estimate UIAS-free survival, and Cox proportional hazard models were applied to 
identify factors associated with the risk of UIAS.
RESULTS: Among 403 patients with 790 renal units, UIAS was identified in 39 
(9.7%) patients and 53 (6.7%) renal units. Forty-four (83.0%) patients with UIAS 
were diagnosed within 6 months. The 1- and 2-year overall UIAS-free rates were 
93.9% and 92.7%, respectively. Paralytic ileus was identified in 105 (26.1%) 
patients and resolved with supportive treatment. Febrile UTI occurred in 57 
patients (14.1%). However, there was no leak of the UIA.
CONCLUSIONS: Stentless UIA during RC with an ileal orthotopic neobladder is a 
feasible and safe surgical option. Further prospective randomized trials are 
required to determine the clinical usefulness of stentless UIA during RC.

Tuberculous bladder contracture with a bilateral duplicated collecting system is 
rare. According to anatomic variation, the surgical treatment strategy is highly 
individualized. We illustrate our robotic technique of urinary tract 
reconstruction. A 19-year-old girl with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 
as a young child presented with a complaint of increasing frequency of 
micturition, nocturia, urgency, and urge incontinence starting at the age of 17. 
Clinical and imaging examinations demonstrated tuberculous contracted bladder 
with a bilateral duplex collecting system. The patient underwent a 
robot-assisted Institute of Urology Peking University (IUPU) orthotopic ileal 
neobladder reconstruction. This is a modified urinary tract reconstructive 
method, including resection of the end of the duplex ureters and diseased 
contracted bladder with preservation of the proximal urethra and bladder neck, 
ileal harvesting and IUPU strategy to reconstruct an ileal neobladder, 
uretero-ileal anastomosis and neobladder-bladder neck anastomosis. The patient 
remained symptom-free without recurrence of TB and had improved renal function 
during the one-year follow-up after surgery. Thus, our robot-assisted IUPU 
orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction method is an effective approach for 
this benign case. It can effectively increase bladder capacity, reduce 
intravesical pressure, and improve symptoms such as urination frequency and 
urgency.

OBJECTIVE: To compare perioperative and oncologic outcomes of intracorporeal 
(ICNB) and extracorporeal neobladder (ECNB) following robot assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) from a multi-institutional, prospectively maintained database, 
the International Robotic Cystectomy Consortium (IRCC).
METHODS: A retrospective review of IRCC database between 2003 and 2020 (3742 
patients from 33 institutions across 14 countries) was performed (I-79606). The 
Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess utilization of ICNB over time. 
Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to evaluate variables 
associated with receiving ICNB, overall complications, high-grade complications, 
and readmissions after RARC. Kaplan Meier curves were used to depict 
recurrence-free, disease-specific, and overall survival.
RESULTS: Four hundred eleven patients received neobladder, 64% underwent ICNB. 
ICNB utilization increased significantly over time (P <.01). Patients who 
received ICNB were readmitted and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy more 
frequently (36% vs 24%, P = .03, 35% vs 8%, P <.01, respectively). ICNB was 
associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P = .001), receipt of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 4.63, 95% CI 2.34-9.18, P <.01), and more recent 
RARC era (2016-2020) (OR 12.6, 95% CI 5.6-28.4, P <.01). On multivariate 
analysis, ICNB (OR 5.43, 95% CI 2.34-12.58, P <.01), positive surgical margin 
(OR 4.88, 95% CI 1.29-18.42, P = .019), longer operative times (OR 1.26, 95% CI 
1.00-1.58, P = .048), and institutional annual RARC volume (OR 1.09, 95% CI 
1.05-1.12, P <.01) were associated with readmissions.
CONCLUSION: Utilization of ICNB increased significantly over time. Patients who 
underwent RARC and ICNB had shorter hospital stays and fewer 30-d reoperations 
but were readmitted more frequently compared to those who underwent ECNB.

OBJECTIVE: To improve the complications of traditional laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy (LRC), a novel technique of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy (ELRC) with preservation of fertility was described.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Selected patients with bladder cancer were treated with 
the ELRC technique. The seminal vesicles and the vas deferens were preserved. 
Patient's perioperative conditions, tumor prognosis, and follow-up data were 
analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: We successfully completed ELRC surgery in dozens of patients. The 
orthotopic ileal neobladder was placed in the extraperitoneal area, completely 
preserving the peritoneum. The postoperative complications caused by 
postoperative peritoneal loss were reduced. Moreover, the perioperative period 
was strictly managed with the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). 
We described the operation process in detail through a typical case of a child. 
All patients were free of complication at short-term follow-up, and reported 
satisfied sexual function with normal erections.
CONCLUSION: The ELRC technique has benefits in terms of decreased ileus, 
reoperation rates, hospital stay, ease of management of urinary leaks, and 
improves the patient quality of life. ELRC is also an oncologically safe 
approach with excellent significant functional outcomes in carefully selected 
transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) or non-TCC patients who expect to maintain 
sexual function and fertility, especially for young patients. In addition, more 
patient groups and longer follow-ups are needed to further understand the safety 
and practicality of the ELRC technology.

BACKGROUND: To assess predictors, indicators and medical necessity of 
readmissions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy in order to 
identify opportunities for reducing readmission rates.
METHODS: Records for patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy between 2007 and 2017 were reviewed 
for 90-day complications and readmission. Readmissions were classified as 
necessary vs. discretionary based on independent clinician review. The 
association between postoperative complications and necessary or discretionary 
readmission were examined with adjusted regression models.
RESULTS: Among a total of 250 patients, 76 patients (30.4%) were readmitted 
within 90 days of surgery (19 discretionary and 57 necessary). Age, insurance 
coverage, and comorbidity were similar between readmitted and non-readmitted 
patients. Readmission was more likely after neobladder than ileal conduit (39% 
vs. 23%, P = 0.02). Major (grade ≥ 3) complications within 90-day of surgery 
including index admission and post-discharge period were significantly more 
common among re-admitted patients compared to patients who were not readmitted 
(40% in necessary, 21% in discretionary, 3% in none, P < 0.001). Median length 
of stay on readmission was twice as long in necessary cases compared to 
discretionary cases (5 vs. 2.5 days, P < 0.001). Gastrointestinal and infectious 
complications were associated with discretionary readmission in adjusted 
analyses, while infectious, renal/genitourinary and thromboembolic complications 
were associated with necessary readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of readmissions were categorized as 
discretionary and were driven primarily by low-grade gastrointestinal 
complications, marginal oral intake and failure to thrive, suggesting that 
better coordinated post-discharge supportive care could help avoid a substantial 
proportion of readmissions.

Continent diversion with orthotopic neobladder is the most upcoming form of 
urinary diversion postradical cystectomy. This allows patients to void through 
the native urethra preserving the maximal quality of life. These patients with 
greater life expectancies increasingly present with a wide range of late 
complications, which also include local recurrences involving neobladder. Such 
presentations on surveillance scans can be challenging for radiologists 
unfamiliar with expected post-surgical anatomy and usual sites of local 
recurrences. Tumour in neobladder, although rare, has predilection concerning 
specific sites of involvement and few distinct histological types. Major 
subtypes of such recurrences with corresponding radiological features on 
multimodality imaging have been discussed in this article. Management of such 
cases with revision of diversions is challenging, and surgeons expect a 
meticulous read of such scans before contemplating pelvic clearance and 
secondary diversions. This pictorial review aims to appraise the literature 
related to various primary and secondary types of tumours involving reservoir 
and anastomotic sites in an orthotopic neobladder, their relative incidences and 
illustrate salient imaging points with case examples.

Invasive urothelial carcinoma has a propensity for disparate differentiation and 
presentation of morphological variants. Sarcomatoid carcinoma (SaC) of the 
bladder is an extremely uncommon and aggressive variant of bladder cancer. An 
accurate diagnosis for this variant is necessary, but at times difficult. 
Immunohistochemistry can increase the diagnostic accuracy for SaC. The 
therapeutic approaches currently adopted for the treatment of SaC are similar to 
those used for the urothelial variant: Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy. To date, however, there exists no standard treatment due to the lack of 
knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of SaC. Future research is required to 
focus on this rare histological tumor subtype in order to identify more 
effective treatment strategies. The present study reported an unusual case of 
bladder SaC in a woman aged 48 years, who was a non-smoker with a long history 
of benzodiazepine abuse. Although saving the patient's life was a priority, it 
was also essential to consider her subsequent quality of life. For that reason, 
the patient underwent a cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder reconstruction 
using ileum, followed by chemotherapy. At the 7 month follow-up, the patient was 
still alive, in complete remission and had normal bladder function. The present 
case report shows the potential contribution of benzodiazepine abuse in the 
development of a bladder sarcomatoid carcinoma, a rare variant of BC, whose 
early detection and accurate diagnosis are key to attaining satisfactory 
treatment outcomes and a favorable prognosis for patients.

Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the perioperative, 
oncological, and functional results and complications of extracorporeal 
orthotopic neobladder (EON) and totally intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder 
(ION) after laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) in patients with 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer and high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. 
Methods: From January 2013 to October 2019, 152 patients underwent LRC and 
U-shape neobladder urinary diversion at a single tertiary referral hospital. We 
then compared the extracorporeal (n = 62) and intracorporeal (n = 90) orthotopic 
neobladder after laparoscopic cystectomy groups. Results: Of all patients, 90 
with ION and 62 with EON were included in the study. Concerning perioperative 
outcomes, the ION group had lower estimated blood loss (455.7 versus 371.7 mL, 
P = .019), a shorter interval to solid food (6.9 versus 8.7 days, P = .006), and 
a shorter length of hospital stay (14.6 versus 16.0 days, P = .009). No 
statistically significant differences were identified in overall (P = .649), 
early (P = .509), and late (P = .367) complications. However, in terms of 
gastrointestinal complications, the ION group had a lower complication rate than 
the EON group (11.1% versus 27.4%, P = .018). There were no statistically 
significant differences in cancer-specific or noncancer-specific mortality. 
Daytime and nocturnal continence rates for the ION versus EON groups were 86.7% 
and 87.1% (P = 1) and 70.0% versus 66.1% (P = .614), respectively. Patients who 
underwent intracorporeal urinary diversion had a higher health-related quality 
of life within 3 months postoperative than the extracorporeal urinary diversion 
group. Conclusion: LRC with ION could be an alternative to EON with similar 
oncological and functional outcomes at tertiary referral centers. ION had 
advantages of faster bowel recovery, fewer gastrointestinal complications, and 
higher quality of life within 3 months postoperative. Clinical Trial

PURPOSE: To compare perioperative results of intracorporeal ileal conduit (ICIC) 
and intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder (ICONB) following laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 ICIC patients and 32 ICONB patients were 
included. Propensity score matching was performed based on: age, body mass 
index, gender, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, history of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, history of abdominal surgery, history of smoking and enhanced 
recovery protocols. Primary outcomes were length of stay and 30-day 
complications. Secondary outcomes were operative time and estimated blood loss.
RESULTS: ICONB was more likely to be performed in younger patients (P < 0.001). 
Other baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were similar (P > 0.05). ICIC 
showed shorter length of stay (11 days vs. 14 days, P = 0.031) and faster pelvic 
drainage tube removal (6 days vs. 9 days, P = 0.014). Operative time, estimated 
blood loss, 30-day complications were similar in the 2 groups (P > 0.05). 
However, postoperative fever was significantly lower in ICIC group (19.6% vs. 
62.5%, P < 0.001). After propensity score matching, ICIC still showed shorter 
length of stay (10 days vs. 15 days, P = 0.002) and less postoperative fever 
(15% vs. 65%, P = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, ICONB was independently 
associated with length of stay≥14 days and postoperative fever both before and 
after propensity score matching (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In our research, ICONB was more likely to be performed in younger 
patients. ICIC and ICONB showed no difference on 30-day complications, operative 
time and estimated blood loss. ICIC group showed shorter length of stay, faster 
pelvic drainage tube removal and less postoperative fever.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy is a complicated surgery with significant risks. 
Complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 range from 25% to 40% while risk of 
mortality is 2%. Pelvic surgery or radiotherapy prior to radical cystectomy 
increases the challenges of this surgery.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether radical cystectomy performed in patients with 
prior history of pelvic surgery or radiation was associated with increased 
frequency of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications compared to patients 
without prior pelvic intervention.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent radical 
cystectomy at our center over a 7-year period. All patients with pelvic 
radiation or surgery prior to radical cystectomy comprised group 1, while group 
2 included the remaining patients.
RESULTS: In our study, 65 patients required radical cystectomy at our 
institution during the study period. Group 1 was comprised of 17 patients and 
group 2 included 48 patients. Four patients from group 2 received orthotopic 
neobladder, while an ileal conduit procedure was performed in the remaining 
patients. Estimated blood loss and the amount of blood transfusions given was 
the only variable found to be statistically different between the two groups. 
One patient from group 1 had four pelvic interventions prior to surgery, and her 
cystectomy was aborted.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical cystectomy may be safely performed in patients with a 
history of pelvic radiotherapy or surgery, with complication rates similar to 
those of non-irradiated or operated pelvises.

BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
neobladder (ICNB) remains a very complicated, technically demanding and 
time-consuming surgical procedure. In the current study we describe our 
robot-assisted intracorporeal "Shell" neobladder reconstruction.
METHODS: From January 2017 to December 2019, we performed 30 intracorporeal 
ileal neobladder "Shell" reconstructions. We prospectively collected 
demographics and clinical and pathological data and retrospectively analysed 
perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes.
RESULTS: No conversion to open surgery or intraoperative blood transfusion was 
necessary. The median whole operative time was 493 min (IQR 433-530 min), 
ranging from 514 min (IQR 502-554 min) recorded during the first ten procedures 
to 470 min (IQR 442-503 min) of the last ten. The median estimated blood loss 
was 400 mL (IQR 350-700 mL). The median length of stay was 11 days (IQR 10-17). 
Both early and late complication rates were 46.7%. The high-grade early 
complication rate accounted for 20%, while the high-grade late complication rate 
was 30%. The daytime continence rate registered was 73.3%, while night-time 
continence rate was 60%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated "Shell" neobladder reconstruction as a 
technically feasible procedure, with good functional outcomes in tertiary 
referral centre. Longer follow-up and larger populations are needed to validate 
these preliminary results.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the construction of orthotopic neobladder has 
become the focus of research. Our study is aim to illustrate and evaluate 
surgical techniques, oncologic and functional outcomes of two types of modified 
ileal orthotopic neobladders (IONB).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed of 64 patients who underwent laparoscopic 
radical cystectomy (LRC) + Xing's neobladder (n=41), Institute of Urology Peking 
University neobladder (IUPUB) (n=23) at two tertiary referral centers. Then 
demographic characteristics, operation outcomes were analyzed. In addition, 
postoperative complication rates, oncologic outcomes, continence, and 
neobladders' function were further evaluated.
RESULTS: All LRC + IONB were carried out in 64 patients successfully. 
Pathological results show that 63 were urothelial carcinoma and 1 was 
adenocarcinoma. Time to flatus was 3 [1-6] d in Xing's neobladder group while 3 
[2-5] d in IUPUB group (P=0.049). In terms of overall survival (OS), cancer 
specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), there is no 
statistical difference between the two groups. Overall, grade 1-2 complications 
were 36%, grade 3-4 complications were 1.6% on the 30th day, and 15.6%, 1.6% 
respectively on the 90th day. On the whole, daytime and night continence were 
96.4%, 83.6% respectively one year after operation.
CONCLUSIONS: The two types of modified IONB are safe and feasible. The technical 
improvements significantly simplify the procedure and decrease the difficulty of 
the surgery, probably shorten the operative time and reduce blood loss. 
Furthermore, they take the advantage of less late complications and comparative 
good functional outcomes without affecting the prognosis of oncology. In 
addition, Xing's neobladder is more beneficial to the recovery of postoperative 
gastrointestinal function.

Robotic radical cystectomy with urinary diversion has become increasingly 
utilized for the surgical management of bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction is still performed worldwide primarily via an extracorporeal 
approach because of the difficulty associated with robotic intracorporeal 
reconstruction. The objective of this article is to demonstrate a stepwise 
approach for robotic intracorporeal neobladder in a standardized manner that 
adheres to the principles of open surgery.

BACKGROUND: We have proposed a modified, completely intrafascial radical 
cysprostatectomy (RC) to treat bladder cancer patients with the aim of 
preserving the patients' post-surgical urinary control and erectile function. 
This study aimed to evaluate the oncological and functional outcomes of this 
innovation relatively to that with the conventional technique.
METHODS: A retrospective, single-center, blinded, and controlled study was 
conducted using the medical data of patients since the past 5 years from the 
hospital database. A total of 44 patients were included, including 20 who 
received complete intrafascial cysprostatectomy and 24 who received conventional 
interfascial surgeries. The patients' continent and sexual information of 1-year 
follow-up after the surgery were extracted. The oncological and functional 
outcomes of the 2 groups were compared and analyzed.
RESULTS: The demographics parameters of the 2 groups showed no significant 
difference. The results of follow-up of the oncological outcomes did not reveal 
any significant difference between the completely intrafascial group and the 
conventional interfascial group in terms of the positive surgical margins, local 
recurrences, and distant metastasis. Patients following neobladder diversion in 
the intrafascial group showed a faster recovery of the urinary control, with a 
76.9% (10/13) daytime continent rate at 3-month, as well as 46.2% (6/13) and 
58.3% (7/12) nighttime continent rates at 3-month and 6-month, respectively. 
Regarding the sexual functions, our results revealed significant advantages in 
favor of completely intrafascial technique on the post-surgical International 
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 score at 3-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up 
relative to that with the conventional interfascial process. Thus, the IIEF 
score of patients in the intrafascial group was 11.4 ± 3.5 at 3-month, 
14.1 ± 3.6 at 9-month, and 15.2 ± 3.8 at 12-month follow-up after the 
cystectomy, which was significantly greater than that of the patients in the 
control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel data illustrated that the modified completely 
intrafascial technique could result in a better sexual function and faster 
continence recovery for patients following RC, without any compromise in the 
cancer control. Thus, this technique could be considered as an alternative 
extirpative technique for bladder cancer treatment in a clinical setting.

INTRODUCTION: After radical cystectomy, orthotopic neobladder is one surgical 
strategy for urinary diversion. To assess the usefulness of an operation, 
long-term data are essential. We examined long-term complications and continence 
rates of orthotopic ileocecal (MAINZ pouch) bladder substitution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 2011, 193 patients underwent orthotopic 
MAINZ pouch bladder substitution. Until July 2000, ureter implantation was 
performed into the ascending colon through a submucosal tunnel technique 
(Goodwin-Hohenfellner). After July 2000, ureters were implanted into the 
terminal Ileum using the ileocecal valve to prevent reflux: the left spatulated 
ureter by an end-to-end (Wallace) and the right ureter by an end-to side 
technique (Nesbit). Surgical and medical follow-up reports were evaluated and a 
recent follow-up was obtained by a questionnaire.
RESULTS: Median follow-up in 183 patients was 72 months (1-336). A total of 74 
patients (38%) died during the follow-up. A surgical intervention was required 
in 26 out of 193 patients with early complications while 45 out of 183 patients 
had late and 17 patients had both, early and late complications. Ureteral 
stenosis was found in 13% of submucosal implanted ureters, 13% with the Wallace 
technique, and 3.6% with the Nesbit technique. In total, 66 patients responded 
to the questions concerning long-term continence (minimal follow-up >2 years). 
Overall, 84.8% were completely continent, 1.6%, reported grade I and 9.8% grade 
II stress incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term continence and complication rates are comparable to 
those of other types of orthotopic bladder substitution. Orthotopic MAINZ pouch 
procedure can be considered as one of the options for orthoptic diversion, which 
stands the test of time.

INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
urinary diversion (ICUD) is a technically difficult procedure. Our aim was to 
evaluate the potential impact of the learning curve (LC) on perioperative and 
pathological outcomes of RARC with ICUD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients who 
underwent RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer between 2015-2020. We compared 3 
consecutive groups of 20 (G1), 20 (G2), and 22 (G3) patients to analyze the 
impact of the LC. G1 cases were performed by a senior surgeon experienced in 
robotic surgery, while G2-G3 were performed by 2 junior surgeons without 
experience under the mentorship of the senior surgeon.
RESULTS: The 3 groups had similar clinical and pathological characteristics. A 
total of 15 patients (24%) received a neobladder and 47 (75%) an ileal conduit. 
The mean operative time decreased 60minutes between G1-G3 (P=0.001). No 
conversions to open approach or intraoperative complications were reported. 
There were no differences between groups regarding positive margin rates (P=0.6) 
or the number of lymph nodes removed (P=0.061). The postoperative complication 
rate was 77% and did not change during the LC (P=0.49). Uretero-enteric 
stricture rate decreased from 25% in G1 to 9% in G3 (P=0.217).
CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of júnior surgeons to a RARC with ICUD program after 
the initial 20 cases does not have an impact on the perioperative and 
pathological outcomes of the procedure. The operative time and the 
uretero-enteric stricture rate could be reduced during the LC.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the functional outcomes and quality of life beyond 1 
year, in patients treated with radical cystectomy and orthotopic diversion for 
invasive bladder cancer. To investigate various potential contributing factors 
on patient's quality of life after radical cystectomy and urinary diversion via 
orthotopic neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo; including a total of 97 patients who underwent 
radical cystectomy and orthotopic diversion. Functional and sexual outcome and 
patient QoL were assessed by ICIQ-SF, IIEF-5 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires. 
Potential association of patient QoL with pre-and intraoperative variables was 
studied.
RESULTS: Our results show that preoperative ECOG performance status 0 
(P=0.0001), and nerve sparing surgery (P=0.001), were associated with high QoL 
and functional outcomes. On the contrary, ECOG performance status 2, 
preoperative comorbidities as ischemic heart diseases (P=0.01), recurrence 
(0.041), adjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.017) and radiotherapy (P=0.001) were 
associated with low QoL on univariate analysis. However, only ECOG performance 
status 2 (P<0.0001), incontinence (P<0.0001), non-nerve sparing surgery 
(P=0.001) and ureteric stricture (P=0.001) were independent predictors of worse 
QoL on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Orthotopic bladder is associated with increased morbidity. Attention 
should be given to preoprative patient characteristics at the time of patient 
selection, and intraoperative quality of functional preservation.

Women undergoing a radical cystectomy (RC) followed by a urinary diversion (UD) 
for bladder cancer (BC), experience a substantial reduction in health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL). At present, studies comparing long-term QOL outcomes 
for different UD methods in female patients are lacking. We summarize the 
current state of the QoL assessment in female patients after an RC.

Park), Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND: After radical cystectomy, many bladder cancer patients experience 
physical and psychological difficulties. For nurses, understanding the illness 
experiences should be the utmost priority.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to comprehensively understand the 
experiences of illness among bladder cancer patients with radical cystectomy in 
Korea.
METHODS: Purposive sampling was used in this qualitative study to recruit 
patients hospitalized with bladder cancer at the urology cancer center in South 
Korea. Data were collected through one-on-one in-depth interviews and analyzed 
using the thematic analysis of Braun and Clarke.
RESULTS: Six themes were derived: "confusion with bodily changes," "loss of 
daily life as it was before radical cystectomy," "feeling daunted," "body 
acceptance," "adaptation," and "feeling grateful for life." These themes 
represent the emotional state and adaptation process after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the understanding of the experience of 
illness in Korean adults experiencing bladder cancer. Whereas most previous 
research focuses on physical aspects, including treatment methods, this study 
focused on understanding the life and suffering after discharge of individuals. 
This study can help nurses to better understand the postoperative life of the 
patients.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study can be a foundation for developing 
informational materials or intervention programs needed to solve the 
difficulties encountered during urostomy or neobladder self-care. Specifically, 
a strategy has to be devised to alleviate the pain of loss and to help patients 
who feel daunted and experience a negative body image.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of mebeverine for nocturnal incontinence 
in male patients with an ileal orthotopic bladder substitute (OBS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was carried out for adult 
male patients who were nocturnal incontinent. Patients were allocated to receive 
mebeverine 200 mg or placebo once a day in the evening for 3 months. The primary 
outcome was to compare the continence status between groups, assessed by the 
urinary domain of the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) and pad usage. The secondary 
outcomes were to assess the safety of mebeverine.
RESULTS: There were 55 patients in the placebo group and 58 in mebeverine group 
who completed the follow-up. The median (interquartile range) interval between 
OBS surgery and starting treatment was 9 (4-13) years in the placebo group and 
9 (6-13) years in the mebeverine group. The mean (SD) 3-month urinary domain 
score of the BCI was 70.8 (5.6) and 86.4 (14.2) in the placebo and mebeverine 
groups, respectively (P < 0.001). At 3 months, 54 (98.2%) and 26 (44.8%) 
patients required the use of a night-time pad in the placebo and mebeverine 
groups, respectively. Mebeverine reduced the risk of pad use by 53.4% (95% 
confidence interval 40.1-66.6; P < 0.001). Constipation occurred in one (2.1%) 
and three (5.8%) patients in the placebo and mebeverine groups, respectively; 
abdominal distention occurred in two (3.8%) of the patients in the mebeverine 
group (P = 0.25).
CONCLUSION: Mebeverine decreases night-time pad use and improves the quality of 
life in male patients with an ileal OBS and is associated with minimal adverse 
events.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the published literature regarding pelvic organ 
prolapse, dehiscence or evisceration, vaginal fistula, and dyspareunia after 
radical cystectomy and to describe the management approaches used to treat these 
conditions.
METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically 
searched from January 1, 2001 to January 25, 2021 using a combination of search 
terms for bladder cancer and radical cystectomy with terms for four categories 
of vaginal complications (prolapse, fistula, evisceration/dehiscence, and 
dyspareunia). A total of 229 publications were identified, the final review 
included 28 publications.
RESULTS: Neobladder vaginal fistula was evaluated in 17 publications, with an 
incidence rate of 3 - 6% at higher volume centers, often along the anterior 
vaginal wall at the location of the neobladder-urethral anastomosis. Sexual 
function was evaluated in 10 studies, 7 of which utilized validated instruments. 
Maintaining the anterior vaginal wall and the distal urethra appeared to be 
associated with improved sexual function. Pelvic organ prolapse was assessed in 
5 studies, only 1 used a validated questionnaire and none included a validated 
objective measure of pelvic organ support.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for more prospective studies, using standardized 
instruments and subjective outcome measures to better define the incidence of 
vaginal complications after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer, and to 
understand their impact on quality of life measures.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the 
incidence and risk factors of urethral recurrence (UR) as well as summarizing 
data on survival outcomes in patients with UR after radical cystectomy (RC) for 
bladder cancer. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in February 2021 
for studies of patients with UR after RC. Incidence and risk factors of UR were 
the primary endpoints. The secondary endpoint was survival outcomes in patients 
who experienced UR. Twenty-one studies, comprising 9,435 patients, were included 
in the quantitative synthesis. Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) diversion was 
associated with a decreased probability of UR compared to non-ONB (pooled OR: 
0.44, 95% CI: 0.31-0.61, P < 0.001) and male patients had a significantly higher 
risk of UR compared to female patients (pooled OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.83-5.47, P < 
0.001). Among risk factors, prostatic urethral or prostatic stromal involvement 
(pooled HR: 5.44, 95% CI: 3.58-8.26, P < 0.001; pooled HR: 5.90, 95% CI: 
1.82-19.17, P = 0.003, respectively) and tumor multifocality (pooled HR: 2.97, 
95% CI: 2.05-4.29, P < 0.001) were associated with worse urethral 
recurrence-free survival. Neither tumor stage (P = 0.63) nor CIS (P = 0.72) were 
associated with worse urethral recurrence-free survival. Patients with UR had a 
5-year CSS that varied from 47% to 63% and an OS - from 40% to 74%; UR did not 
appear to be related to worse survival outcomes. Male patients treated with 
non-ONB diversion as well as patients with prostatic involvement and tumor 
multifocality seem to be at the highest risk of UR after RC. Risk-adjusted 
standardized surveillance protocols should be developed into clinical practice 
after RC.

Erosion of metal surgical staples is a rare but described surgical complication. 
Staple erosion in a bladder may present with hematuria, urinary tract infection 
(UTI), bladder pain, or fistula. We present a 64-year-old male with a history of 
urothelial carcinoma treated by cystoprostatectomy with neobladder 
reconstruction. Over the next two to three years, he developed hematuria and had 
multiple urine cytologies suspicious for cancer. The cystoscopic evaluation 
revealed staple line erosion but no cancer. We believe this to be the first 
published case of symptomatic staple erosion in a neobladder. Clinicians should 
be aware that staple line erosion in a neobladder can occur and mimic malignancy 
recurrence.

Objective: To present our preliminary experiences of robot-assisted laparoscopic 
radical or partial cystectomy for bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (B/P RMS) in 
children. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted with children who 
underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for B/P RMS between July 2018 and 
March 2020 under the approval of IRB of our center. The patient characteristics, 
tumor position, perioperative information, short time oncologic survival 
outcomes, and urinary function were recorded and evaluated. Results: We 
identified eight children who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for 
B/P RMS. Partial cystectomy was performed on all, but one, patients, who 
underwent radical cystectomy and sigmoid neobladder reconstruction. Preoperative 
chemotherapy was administered to all eight patients, while preoperative 
radiotherapy was conducted in three cases, including one patient with a history 
of pelvic RMS. Unilateral/bilateral ureteral reimplantation was done in four 
cases in which the patients' ureteral orifices were involved. The mean follow-up 
time was 13.3 months, and no local recurrence or metastasis was observed. No 
patient experienced urinary incontinence eventually. Conclusion: Robot-assisted 
laparoscopic resection for bladder RMS in children is safe and feasible. 
Preoperative radiotherapy could decrease the tumor volume so that the membranous 
urethra could be preserved for as long as possible. The oncologic efficacy and 
the overall survival rate require further investigation and longer follow-up.

The presence of a neobladder constitutes a limitation for the radiation 
oncologist, as there is no clear evidence about its tolerance to radiotherapy 
(RT). The limited literature only concerns the conventional postoperative 
treatment in patients with bladder cancer after cystectomy. Here we report a 
case of a patient with neobladder who underwent a stereotactic RT for a pelvic 
recurrence of disease, with response to treatment and no toxicity to the 
neobladder. This case represents a promising example of the chance to perform RT 
with ablative intent, using advanced techniques, even on lesions close to the 
neobladder.

Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Orthotopic urinary diversion (OUD), or neobladder, is 
believed to be the gold standard for surgical bladder reconstruction following 
radical cystectomy though it is performed far less often than ileal conduits. As 
both a continent and intracavitary diversion, OUDs offer unique advantages for 
patients. Their utilization has decreased overall though, especially with the 
advent of robotic surgery. In this review, we will cover patient selection for 
OUD, functional outcomes (i.e., continence, sexual activity, quality of life 
[QoL]), and robotic orthotopic diversions.
RECENT FINDINGS: OUDs have seen a proportionally greater decline in utilization 
compared with ileal conduits as the number of robotic radical cystectomies being 
performed with intracorporeal diversions increases. Multiple robotic series have 
demonstrated less perioperative blood loss and shorter hospital stays when 
compared with the open approach though operative times are longer, the learning 
curve is steeper, and overall costs may be higher in some settings. 
Perioperative safety and short-term oncological outcomes appear comparable. 
Since robotic OUDs are relatively new, functional outcomes are not yet well 
established. Patient satisfaction with urinary diversion is associated with 
informed decision-making tailored to the patient. A thorough understanding of 
expected short- and long-term functional outcomes and the care required to 
maintain an OUD improves QoL and satisfaction with diversion choice.
SUMMARY: Given the potential advantages of OUD, its decreasing use is a 
remarkable trend. Shared decision-making and a patient-centered approach should 
be used when selecting the type of urinary diversion.

BACKGROUND: We assessed urinary continence recovery and perioperative 
complications in patients operated on with the novel urethral fixation technique 
during open radical cystectomy (RC) with ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 82 consecutive male patients undergoing open 
RC with IONB between 07/2013 and 06/2020 was analyzed. A study group of 48 
patients operated on with the urethral fixation technique was compared with a 
control group of 34 patients receiving standard neovesico-urethral anastomosis. 
In the study group, the urethral stump was fixed to the dorsal median raphe 
posteriorly and to the medial portion of levator ani muscle postero-laterally in 
order to avoid urethral retraction/deviation. Urinary continence recovery and 
perioperative complications were assessed and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with regard to demographic, clinical and 
pathological variables. At the median follow-up of 36 months, 42 (87.5%) 
patients in the study, and 22 (64.7%) in the control group during daytime, and 
32 (66.7%) patients in the study, and 15 (44.1%) patients in the control group 
during nighttime used no pads or a safety pad (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively). 
Ninety-day postoperative complications were observed in 14 (29.2%) patients in 
the study, and in 10 (29.4%) cases in the control group (P=0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: In our exploratory case-control study of male patients undergoing 
open RC with IONB, we observed a significant improvement in daytime and 
nighttime urinary continence recovery with no increase in perioperative 
complications using the novel urethral fixation technique compared to the 
standard neovesical-urethral anastomosis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To study the recent literature on health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) in patients after radical cystectomy followed by urinary diversion.
RECENT FINDINGS: General consensus regarding, which urinary diversion is 
superior in terms of HRQOL has not been reached. Although there is an increase 
in studies favoring the orthotopic neobladder, overall quality of these studies 
is poor. Other studies suggest that HRQOL outcomes in different types of urinary 
diversions is similar and that other factors, such as age, comorbidities and sex 
are more important instead. Patient choice, in consultation with the treating 
surgeon should be the determinant of which urinary diversion is performed. 
Furthermore, sexual function can play an important role in HRQOL. However, 
practice shows that counselling on the option of sexual-preserving techniques is 
still not implemented in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, studies 
regarding differences in HRQOL after urinary diversion between male and female 
individuals are lacking.
SUMMARY: Thorough preoperative counselling on the different types of urinary 
diversion and options for sexual-preserving techniques decreases decision regret 
and increases HRQOL in patients after radical cystectomy.

OBJECTIVE: To show different approaches for sexual-sparing robot assisted 
radical cystectomy in women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radical cystectomy (RC) is a mainstay treatment for 
localized muscle invasive bladder cancer and high-risk non muscle invasive 
bladder cancer not responding to adequate endovesical therapy.1 In women 
traditionally RC is performed with hystero-adnexectomy and resection of the 
anterior vaginal wall, but this technique often brings sexual disorders. With 
time, vaginal sparing techniques have been developed to improve functional 
outcomes in women motivated to preserve their sexual function.2-4 The 
indications for vaginal-sparing RC are absence of tumor in bladder neck or 
urethra and no sign of infiltration of anterior vaginal wall and parametria at 
preoperative staging.
RESULTS: Procedure steps as follows. Step 1: Bilateral adnexectomy and ureteral 
isolation until their distal portion. Step 2: Vesico-vaginal dissection. Step 3: 
Bilateral pelvic and common iliac node dissection. Step 4: Ureteral clamping and 
section. Step5: Posterolateral bladder pedicle dissection. Step 6: Anterior 
dissection of the bladder towards the urethra. In women, this should be achieved 
without injuring the Santorini plexus and innervation of the clitoris. Step 7: 
Bladder neck identification and urethral dissection. Cystectomy is completed. 
Step 8: En bloc hystero-adnexectomy with anterior vaginal wall preservation; the 
vaginal pedicles are spared too. Step 9: Specimen extraction from the vagina and 
vaginal suture.It is also possible to perform a fully sexual-sparing robotic RC 
by following the vesico-vaginal plan without dissecting the vaginal dome and 
leaving internal genitalia intact. This technique is typically carried out in 
case of young women with no pathological uterine and ovarian 
findings.Vesico-vaginal plan can also be developed after opening the vaginal 
dome. This approach gives the possibility to subsequently dissect the cervix, to 
identify and spare the vaginal pedicles and to perform an "en bloc" radical 
cystectomy, with preservation of the anterior vaginal wall.In case of 
neobladder, diversion is carried out intracorporeally following the principles 
of the Saint Augustin neobladder.5 CONCLUSIONS: Robot assisted anterior 
pelvectomy with anterior vaginal wall preservation is a feasible and 
mini-invasive technique. For a satisfying functional result, it is crucial to 
preserve the vaginal neurovascular pedicles. This sexual-sparing approach must 
be carried out after a correct patient selection: women motivated to preserve 
their sexual function and ideally in the neobladder setting, when a posterior 
support for the urinary diversion is needed. Absence of tumor in bladder neck 
and urethra at magnetic resonance imaging could help patient selection.

PURPOSE: We report our preliminary experience of using a hybrid ileal pouch, 
assessing oncologic outcomes, complications, voiding, and renal function.
METHODS: The study included 25 patients with bladder cancer treated with radical 
cystectomy with a hybrid ileal pouch with concomitant anti-refluxing and 
refluxing anastomosis, performed by a single surgeon. The patients were divided 
into two groups (first and last cases) according to the surgery date. 
Postoperative complications, separate renal function by renal scan, voiding 
function by uroflowmetry with residual urine, and oncologic outcomes were 
assessed.
RESULTS: The surgery duration was shorter in the last cases than the first 
cases. The voiding volume increased with time. There were 23 cases of grade 3 
complication in 12 patients and one case of grade 4 complication (sepsis). In 
the first cases, ureterovesical stenosis occurred in five cases, whereas in the 
last cases, there were no cases of stenosis. In separate renal function, there 
was no difference between the left and right side or between the first and last 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid ileal pouch showed acceptable oncologic and functional 
outcomes and complications; therefore, it can be used according to the 
appropriate surgical situation with a relatively short bowel segment during 
neobladder construction.

BACKGROUND: Minimally-invasive approach is one of the mainstays of Enhanced 
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways. Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) 
introduction has reduced the surgical burden on patient's recovery. Accordingly, 
ERAS protocol benefits may be more striking in RARC patients. We evaluated the 
impact of surgical approach on perioperative outcomes, Fast Track (FT) recovery 
steps and Trifecta success rates in patients undergoing RC followed by FT 
protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We considered 147 patients who underwent RC, with open 
(Open radical cystectomy [ORC]; 47.6%) or robotic (RARC; 52.4%) approach at 2 
tertiary centers. Urinary diversions were ileal conduit or orthotopic 
neobladder. All patients underwent FT protocol. We analyzed perioperative 
surgical and functional outcomes and Trifecta success rates (namely, defecation 
<5 days, in-hospital stay <10 days and no major complications). Uni and 
multivariable logistic regression explored the predictors for Trifecta success 
and the impact of surgical approach on recovery steps.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing RARC had higher FT adherence (95% vs. 61%) compared 
to ORCs (P < 0.01). Trifecta success rates were higher for RARC (79.2% vs 28.6%; 
P < 0.001). At multivariable analyses, RARC was an independent predictor for 
Trifecta success (OR 9.1), early mobilization (OR 5.9) and FT adherence (OR 
3.33; all P < 0.001). Surgical technique was not associated with major 
complications or readmission within 90 days (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: RARC has more favorable perioperative outcomes compared to ORC, with 
higher Trifecta success rates. Accordingly, robotic approach should be ideally 
included in every center where ERAS protocol is applied to RC for maximizing 
patient's recovery.

OBJECTIVE: To report the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC), 
and to identify factors impacting on return to baseline.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing iRARC between January 2016 
and December 2017 completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item core (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and 
EORTC-QLQ-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Module (EORTC-QLQ-BLM30) questionnaires 
before surgery and had a minimum of 12 months follow-up postoperatively.
RESULTS: A total of 76 patients met the inclusion criteria at 12 months. 
Neobladder (NB) cases (n = 24) were younger (57.0 vs 71.0 years, P < 0.001) and 
fitter than ileal conduit (IC) cases (n = 52), and had higher physical (100.0 vs 
93.3, P = 0.039) and sexual functioning (66.7 vs 50.0, P = 0.013) scores at 
baseline. Longitudinal analysis of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 showed that physical (NB: 
93.3 vs 100.0, P = 0.020; IC: 80.0 vs 93.3, P < 0.001) and role functioning 
scores (NB: 83.3 vs 100.0, P = 0.010; IC: 83.3 vs 100.0, P = 0.017) decreased 
and fatigue score (NB: 22.2 vs 11.1, P = 0.026; IC: 33.3 vs 22.2, P = 0.008) 
increased at 3 months in both diversion groups. Scores returned to baseline at 
6 months except physical functioning score in IC patients that remained below 
baseline until 12 months (86.7 vs 93.3, P = 0.012). The global HRQoL score did 
not show significant change postoperatively in both groups. A major 90-day 
Clavien-Dindo complication was a significant predictor (odds ratio [OR] 0.11, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.62; P = 0.012) of deteriorated global HRQoL 
score at 3 months, while occurrence of a late complication (OR 0.14, 95% CI 
0.03-0.65; P = 0.013) was a predictor of deteriorated global HRQoL score at 
12 months. Longitudinal analysis of the EORTC-QLQ-BLM30 showed that urinary 
problems (NB: 14.3 vs 38.3, P < 0.001; IC: 5.6 vs 19.1, P < 0.001) and future 
perspective (NB: 33.3 vs 44.4, P = 0.004; IC: 22.2 vs 44.4, P < 0.001) scores 
were better than baseline at 3 months. Sexual function deteriorated 
significantly at 3 months (NB: 8.3 vs 66.7, P < 0.001; IC: 4.2 vs 50.0, 
P < 0.001) and then showed improvement at 12 months but was still below baseline 
(NB: 33.3 vs 66.7, P = 0.001; IC: 25.0 vs 50.0, P < 0.001). Involvement in 
penile rehabilitation was shown to be a significant predictor (β 18.62, 95% CI 
6.06-30.45; P = 0.005) of higher sexual function score at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: While most functional domains and symptoms scales recover to or 
exceed baseline within 6 months of iRARC, physical function remains below 
baseline in IC patients up to 12 months. Global HRQoL is preserved for both 
types of urinary diversion; however, postoperative complications seem to be the 
main driving factor for global HRQoL. Sexual function is adversely affected 
after iRARC suggesting that structured rehabilitation of sexual function should 
be an integral part of the RC pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To assess both short- and long-term constipation symptoms and their 
impact on quality of life in patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) with 
three different types of urinary diversion: orthotopic neobladder (ONB), 
continent cutaneous diversion (CCD), and ileal conduit (IC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms 
(PAC-SYM) and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) 
questionnaires were administered to all patients at follow-up greater than 30 
days from surgery. Clinical and pathological characteristics were prospectively 
recorded in an institutional review board approved bladder cancer database. 
Using multivariable linear regression analyses, we determined significant 
predictors of improved constipation symptoms and quality of life scores.
RESULTS: A total of 198 patients completed 255 PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL 
questionnaires with a median follow-up time of 1.7 years (IQR: 0.7 - 3.0 years). 
ONB, CCD, and IC were performed in 78%, 5.5%, and 16.5% of patients, 
respectively. Higher bowel function scores (i.e. worse symptoms) were noted at 3 
months post-operatively, while these scores significantly improved over time for 
PAC-SYM total score (P = .004), abdominal subscore (P = .001), and rectal 
subscore (P = .018). On multivariable analysis, we found that patients <70 years 
old (B -2.1, P = .004), with follow-up >1 year (B -4.8, P = .001), and who 
received an IC (B -2.4, P = .02) had significantly lower PAC-SYM scores.
CONCLUSION: Patients have few constipation symptoms and are overall satisfied 
with their bowel function at long-term follow-up after RC. While patients with 
IC have significantly fewer constipation symptoms compared to those with ONB or 
CCD, all patients had significant improvement one year after the surgery.

Radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder are the most preferred surgical 
approaches for the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. Secondary tumour of 
ileum on neobladder is very rare. We report a 67-year man complaining of 
hematuria with the history of ileal neobladder for 19 years.  An ileal 
adenocarcinoma of neobladder was detected with transurethral resection. He also 
had a non-functioning right kidney. A neobladderectomy. with right 
nephroureterectomy and ureterocutaneostomy was performed. An adenocarcinoma 
invading subserosal layer was reported. At six months postoperatively, patient 
was free of recurrence and progression. Seconder tumour of neobladder is a very 
rare condition. Early diagnosis and excision of neobladder may provide cure. Key

INTRODUCTION: Aim of the study was to evaluate the Florence intracorporeal 
neobladder (FloRIN) oncological and functional outcomes at the end of assessment 
phase (phase 3) IDEAL-Guidelines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-institution prospective series included 
consecutive patients treated with robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and 
FloRIN reconfiguration technique from February 2016 to June 2020. Functional 
features were evaluated six months after surgery. Patients were grouped into 
four quartiles according to time of radical cystectomy and impact of learning 
curve improvement was evaluated.
RESULTS: One-hundred FloRIN were completed with a median console time of 373 
(IQR: 312-415) minutes. Two cases were converted to open surgery. No 
intraoperative complications occurred. At pathological examination, 30% of 
patients were staged as pT ≤ 1 and 47% as pT ≥ 3. Transitional cell carcinoma 
was present in 87% of cases. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) and nodal involvement were 
observed in 38% and 29% of patients, respectively. At a median follow-up time of 
17 (IQR: 7-28) months, 20 clinically relevant events (Clavien-Dindo≥3) occurred. 
Operative time significantly decreased throughout the series (median minutes 
435; 395; 365 and 330 in the four quartiles, respectively; p < 0.001). 
Similarly, early Clavien-Dindo≥3 postoperative complications rate significantly 
decreased across the series (number of events: 1; 4; 0; 0; p = 0.03). Overall, 
75% and 65% of patients achieved day-time and nigh-time continence, 
respectively. Twenty-seven patients experienced disease recurrence. 
Cancer-specific and overall survival were equal to 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: RARC with FloRIN reconfiguration showed worthy functional and 
survival outcomes, with learning curve improvement significantly influencing 
operative time and early complications rate across series.

Open radical cystectomy (ORC) remains the gold standard for the treatment of 
muscle-invasive and high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer unsuitable for 
bladder preservation techniques. Despite improvements in operative technique and 
perioperative care, it continues to be associated with significant 
complications. We analyzed our series of prospectively collected data of 
patients who underwent ORC at a tertiary referral academic center and evaluated 
early and late postoperative complications and mortality. The records of 391 
ORCs with ileal diversion performed at our institution between January 2008 and 
July 2018 for non-metastatic transitional bladder carcinoma and other distinct 
pathological types were analyzed. Perioperative mortality was determined and 
30-day and 90-day complications were reported according to the Martin Criteria 
and the European Association of Urology and graded according to the five-grade 
Clavien-Dindo classification. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to 
evaluate predictors of complications and mortality. Gastrointestinal and 
infectious complications represented 41% and 43% of the total complications 
observed at 30 and 90 days after the surgery, respectively. The strongest 
predictor of infectious complications was the choice of ileal neobladder as the 
urinary diversion (p≤0.0001). Diabetes was a predictor of the overall, major and 
major infectious complications (p<0.05). The 30-day mortality rate was 1% while 
the 90-day mortality rate was 1.5%. Age ≥75 was the single predictor of 
mortality at both 30-days (p-value 0.003) and 90-days (p-value 0.01) in 
univariate and multivariate analyses. ORC is a morbid procedure, associated with 
a high mortality rate. Elderly patients should have proper counseling before the 
indication of this procedure. Gastrointestinal and infectious complications 
represent the most common and serious complications, and the study of their 
predictors is of the utmost importance.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several instruments have been designed to evaluate 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with bladder cancer (BC). 
However, they vary in purpose, domains, and quality. To identify QoL instruments 
that have been validated for BC patients and to critically assess their domains 
and limitations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 11 instruments identified, seven have been externally 
validated. Of these, four can be used across all disease states; two are 
available for QoL assessment in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC); and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) module is intended for use together with a generic cancer-specific tool. 
Of the three instruments available to assess QoL in patients with muscle 
invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bladder 
Cancer Muscle Invasive30 (QLQ-BLM30) and Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Bladder-Cystectomy (FACT-Bl-Cys) need to be used each with their 
respective generic core questionnaire, whereas Ileal Orthotopic Neobladder-Pro 
Questionnaire is intended only to evaluate patients who have received an 
orthotopic neobladder.The core domains assessed by these instruments include 
social functioning, mental health, physical function, urinary function and 
sexual function.
SUMMARY: No optimal BC-specific QoL instruments exist. Multiple cancer- and 
BC-specific instruments are required to cover each of the relevant domains. 
Selected tools should be reviewed within the context of specific research 
objectives.

Urinary diversion after cystectomy has been a historical standard for the 
treatment of numerous benign and malignant diseases of the bladder. Since the 
first published description in the early 1900s, improvements in surgical 
technique and a better understanding of the metabolic sequelae postoperatively 
have greatly enhanced patient outcomes. Both continent and incontinent 
diversions are available to patients after cystectomy. In appropriately selected 
patients, orthotopic neobladder reconstruction can offer preservation of body 
image and continence, and continent cutaneous diversions represent a reasonable 
alternative. Conduit diversion, which remains the most commonly performed 
diversion technique, is ideal for patients who would benefit from a less morbid 
surgical procedure that negates the need for self-catheterization. This 
installment of the Core Curriculum in Nephrology outlines numerous aspects of 
urinary diversion, in which a multidisciplinary approach to postoperative 
management at the intersection of nephrology and urology is required to 
effectively optimize patient outcomes. This article includes a discussion of the 
various reconstructive options after cystectomy as well as a comprehensive 
review of frequently encountered short-term and long-term metabolic 
abnormalities associated with altered electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis.

Goal - to determine efficacy of the Ileosigmo-pouch (ISP) as a method of 
transrectal urinary diversion in invasive bladder cancer (BC) treatment. 
Retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients that undergone radical 
cystectomy (RC), followed by ISP method of urinary diversion. Study compared two 
groups of patients: the first group of 22 (23.6%) patients with ISP and the 
control group included 71 (76.4%) patients with Mainz pouch II (MP II) 
diversion. The groups were statistically comparable by major clinical 
parameters. Complication rates were evaluated with Clavien-Dindo classification. 
There were no significant differences in the duration of surgery procedure, - 
ISP 210 - 562 (380.4±38.4) minutes vs. 190 - 557 (311.3±49.5) minutes for MP II. 
Levels of intraoperative blood loss in both groups were comparable: 110 - 2850 
(707.42±97.2) ml vs. 170 - 3000 (788.51±141.3) ml. Peroiperative complications 
after ISP and MP II (1 (4.5%) vs. 6 (4.8%)) did not exceed 3 grade according to 
Clavien-Dindo. The frequency of postoperative chronic pyelonephritis (CP) was 
higher in MP II 26 (24.3%) vs. ISP 3 (15.7%). Gas reflux into the kidneys was 
observed only in MP II 18 (16.8%). Metabolic acidosis was revealed in 27 (25.2%) 
after MP II and in 2 (10.5%) after ISP. During the ISP formation comparing to MP 
II, the pouch volume increased in average up to 1000 ml vs. 750 ml., the 
pressure in a sigmoid colon decreases to 18 cm of water column against 35 cm wc. 
Urination/defecation frequency was improved in patients after ISP - every 3-4 
hours during the day and 5-6 hours at night vs. MP II every 2-3 hours during the 
day and 3-4 hours at night. The ISP method of urinary diversion in our study 
showed improvements of urodynamic parameters and eliminated the body metabolic 
disorders when compared to transrectal diversion with MP2. This viable option of 
diversion in patients with invasive bladder cancer who are not candidates for 
neobladder, but strongly afraid of cutaneous urinary stoma.

PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of action research on 
neobladder function training in patients with orthotopic ileal neobladders.
METHODS: A total of 68 patients with orthotopic ileal neobladders were randomly 
divided into two groups: a control group (31 patients) and an experimental group 
(37 patients). Patients in the control group received neobladder function 
training, while patients in the experimental group received neobladder function 
training based on the action research method. The effects of neobladder function 
training in all patients were evaluated after three months.
RESULTS: (1) The differences between the two groups in micturition time 
interval, urine volume per time, number of incidences of nocturia, and urinary 
continence rate (day time and night time) were statistically significant (P < 
0.05). (2) Compared to the control group (241.6 ± 42.3 mL, 15.1 ± 4.9 mL/s, 23.1 
± 9.9 cmH2O, 63.6 ± 22.3 mL), the bladder capacity (292.6 ± 66.9 mL), maximum 
urinary flow rate (19.2 ± 6.5 mL/s), and bladder detrusor pressure (31.2 ± 11.4 
cmH2O) of the experimental group increased, while the residual urine volume 
(47.2 ± 21.1 mL) decreased (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Neobladder function training based on the action research method can 
improve the neobladder function of patients with orthotopic ileal neobladders.

INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the male 
population is Bladder cancer (BC), while it drops to eleventh when both genders 
are considered. Radical cystectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for 
patients with all muscle-invasive and some nonmuscle invasive BCs. An orthotopic 
continent diversion (neobladder) is preferred whenever possible to achieve a 
better postoperative quality of life. We attempt to study the functional 
outcomes of intracorporeal neobladder (ICNB) versus extracorporeal neobladder 
(ECNB) (ICNB vs. ECNB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients who underwent robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy with neobladder in our institute during the period of March 
2016-March 2018 were included in the study. An orthotopic neobladder (Studer 
method) was created in all our patients. Our main outcomes of interest were peak 
flow rates, residual urine, attainment of continence, and Pdet at qmax of the 
neobladder.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients in our study group was 54 ± 6 years. The mean 
body mass index was 23 ± 2 kg/m2. The mean follow-up period was 24 ± 5 months. 
Twenty patients underwent ICNB and 20 patients underwent ECNB. The urodynamic 
assessment was done 1-year postprocedure. The same parameters applied to an 
intact bladder are used, and results analyzed by comparing it with other 
studies. Common in the initial postoperative period was incontinence which 
reduced substantially over time. After 1-year, 75% of patients did not require 
pads in the daytime, and a meager, <10% used more than one pad per day. There 
was no difference in outcome between both the groups, which was statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSION: Both ICNB and ECNB groups achieved urodynamically proven values of 
adequate bladder capacity and compliance. Daytime continence was excellent, and 
night time continence was good in both groups. Furthermore, there was no 
significant difference between both the groups as regards to urodynamic 
parameters. However, continence is attained little earlier in the ICNB group. 
There is no perceived superiority of ICNB over ECNB.

OBJECTIVES: To compare oncologic endpoints between open radical cystectomy (ORC) 
and robotic-assisted radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion 
(eRARC) or intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients undergoing 
curative-intent radical cystectomy with urinary diversion for urothelial bladder 
cancer at a single-institution from 2010-2018. Primary outcomes included 
recurrence location and rates, recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared 
using log-rank analysis. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to identify 
predictors of survival.
RESULTS: 265, 366 and 285 patients underwent ORC, eRARC, and iRARC, respectively 
(n = 916). Median follow-up was 52, 40 and 37 months for ORC, eRARC and iRARC, 
respectively (P < 0.001). Ileal conduit was more commonly performed in iRARC 
(85%, P < 0.001). Neobladder rates did not vary. Neoadjuvant (p=0.4) or adjuvant 
therapy use (P = 0.36), pT-stage (P = 0.28) or pN-stage (P = 0.1) did not 
differ. Positive soft tissue margin rates were higher in ORC (7.2%-ORC, 
3.6%-eRARC, 3.2%-iRARC, P = 0.041). Differences in recurrence rates or location 
were not observed. Surgical approach was not associated with any survival 
endpoint on proportional-hazards or Kaplan-Meier analysis. Hazard ratios and 95% 
CI for RFS were 1 (0.72-14) and 0.93 (0.66-1.3) for eRARC and iRARC, 
respectively, when compared to ORC as the referent.
CONCLUSION: These findings from a large, single-institution in conjunction with 
randomized-controlled trial data suggest that RARC does not compromise 
perioperative or long-term oncologic outcomes when compared to ORC.

BACKGROUND: In cystectomy patients who underwent neobladder creation, the 
intestinal mucosa of the neobladder is in constant contact with urine, which may 
result in chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA) due to specific absorption 
capabilities of the intestinal mucosa. Despite being a prevalent comorbidity, 
the risk factors for CMA and its diagnostic parameters are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: This review examines the risk factors associated with the 
development of CMA and their prevalence in patients with a neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using the 
PubMed database to detect studies about the topics CMA and neobladder that were 
published between 2000 and 2020. The prevalence and risk factors for CMA in 
neobladder patients were assessed by reviewing 23 studies.
RESULTS: Acidosis is most prevalent during the first year after surgery 
(25-70%). Risk factors are renal failure, high continence, old age and diabetes 
mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CMA is at its highest during the early 
postoperative period for neobladder patients, so for this time period, weekly 
diagnostic investigations are recommended according to the German S3-guidelines 
for the "Früherkennung, Diagnose, Therapie und Nachsorge des 
Harnblasenkarzinomsent für Neoblasepatienten". Blood gas tests should not only 
be used to analyze the pH value but also to detect and counteract acid-base 
imbalance issues in time. The recommended normalization of serum bicarbonate 
levels with oral bicarbonate follows patient-specific therapy strategies.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Bei Zystektomiepatienten mit angelegter 
Neoblase befindet sich das Darmgewebe der Neoblase im ständigen Kontakt mit 
Urin, womit über die Absorptionseigenschaften des Darmgewebes eine 
chronisch-metabolische Azidose (cmA) auftreten kann. Die Risikofaktoren für die 
cmA sind trotz der hohen Prävalenz dieser Komorbidität weitgehend unbekannt und 
die Diagnoseparameter uneinheitlich.
FRAGESTELLUNG: Welche Risikofaktoren stehen in Zusammenhang mit der Ausbildung 
einer chronischen metabolischen Azidose bei cmA-Patienten und wie häufig tritt 
diese auf?
MATERIAL UND METHODE: Mittels einer systematischen Literaturrecherche in PubMed 
wurden Studien im Zeitraum von 2000–2020 zum Thema cmA und Neoblase gesucht. Es 
wurde an Hand von 23 Studien die Prävalenz und Risikofaktoren der cmA in 
Neoblasepatienten untersucht.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Azidose tritt bei Neoblasepatienten am häufigsten innerhalb des 
ersten Jahres nach Neoblasenanlage auf (25–70 %). Risikofaktoren, die mit ihrem 
Auftreten korrelieren, sind Niereninsuffizienz, gute Kontinenz, hohes Alter und 
Diabetes mellitus.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: In der frühen postoperativen Phase ist die Prävalenz der cmA 
bei Neoblasepatienten am größten, entsprechend empfiehlt sich für diesen 
Zeitraum eine wöchentliche Diagnostik gemäß der aktuellen S3-Leitlinie zur 
Früherkennung, Diagnose, Therapie und Nachsorge des Harnblasenkarzinoms für 
Neoblasepatienten. Die Blutgasanalyse sollte neben des pH-Wertes auch mittels 
des BE-Wertes zur Diagnose einer cmA genutzt werden, um Entgleisungen des 
Säure-Basen-Haushalts frühzeitig zu erkennen und zu therapieren. Die empfohlene 
Normalisierung des Bicarbonatspiegels mittels oralen Bicarbonats erfolgt über 
patientenindividuelle Therapieschemata.

Purpose: So far, it has not been described whether the perioperative course and 
the pathologic outcome of patients who undergo radical cystectomy (RC) with 
orthotopic bladder substitution differs if nerve sparing (NS) is performed or 
not. Material and Methods: In all, there were 472 patients who underwent RC 
between 2012 and 2019 at our department. We performed a retrospective analysis 
of 116 patients who underwent RC with ileal neobladder. We analyzed 
perioperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification 
system, as well as the pathological outcome. Results: Of 116 patients, 68 
(58.6%) underwent RC, and 48 (41.4%) underwent NS RC. Clavien-Dindo 
complications ≥3b occurred in 15 (12.9%) of all patients. Only infectious 
complications differed among the groups [NS RC: 25 patients (52.1%) vs. RC: 20 
patients (29.4%); p = 0.02]. There was no significant difference concerning 
tumor stage. Concomitant Cis was present in 24 patients (35.3%) of the RC group 
and in 27 patients (56.3%) of the NS RC group (p = 0.036). Nodal status and 
positive surgical margin status of the bladder tumor did not differ among the 
groups. In all, 42 of all male patients (45.7%) had an incidental prostatic 
carcinoma. Positive surgical margins concerning the prostate carcinoma occurred 
in six patients, with all cases in the RC group (p = 0.029). Conclusions: Our 
data suggest that performing NS during RC in carefully selected patients is a 
safe procedure and does not impair perioperative outcome. Pathological outcome 
of NS RC is comparable as well.

PURPOSE: To explore the application of the neobladder-urethral drag-and-bond 
anastomosis technique in laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) with ileal 
orthotopic neobladder (IONB) reconstruction.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study on a procedure 
performed by a single surgeon. From January 2014 to December 2018, we identified 
43 male bladder cancer patients who received LRC with IONB reconstruction. These 
patients were divided into two groups, with 22 patients undergoing 
neobladder-urethral drag-and-bond anastomosis (NUDA) and 21 patients undergoing 
neobladder-urethral anastomosis under laparoscopy (NUAL). Anastomosis time, 
catheter removal time, postvoid residual (PVR), maximum urinary flow rate 
(Q-max), urine leakage and anastomotic stenosis were used to evaluate the 
simplicity and surgical effect of the two groups.
RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated similar tumor characteristics. A significant 
difference in neobladder-urethral anastomosis time was found between the NUDA 
group and the NUAL group (14.6 ± 0.4 vs 70 ± 2.5 min, P<0.0001), and there was 
no significant difference in other characteristics.
CONCLUSION: The neobladder-urethral drag-and-bond anastomosis technique in LRC 
and IONB reconstruction, with its shorter learning curve, was easier and more 
convenient than neobladder-urethral anastomosis under laparoscopy.

Bacterial presence, anatomic anomalies and metabolic alterations increase the 
risk of stone formation in patients with neobladders. These patients sometimes 
require medical or surgical procedures. The aim of the current work is to 
analyze those alterations and medical treatment associated to it. METHODS: A 
case of a 66 yo male who had undergone a cystectomy with neobladder 3 years ago. 
Currently present with a staghorn stone on the right kidney. Past medical 
history of stone formation as well as double J calcification. RESULTS: The 
combination of medical and surgical treatment for stone was performed. Medical 
therapy will allow prevention of new stones. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and chronic 
infections in patients with neobladders treated should decreased the new stone 
formation in patients with neobladders.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical features, surgical effects and factors that 
may affect prognosis of muscular invasive bladder cancer in young people. 
Methods: The clinical data of young (aged 44 and below) patients with muscle 
invasive bladder cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy at the 
First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from October 1st, 2014 to 
October 31st, 2018 were retrospectively analyzed, which included age, gender, 
body mass index (BMI), tumor discovery method, tumor location, tumor size, 
comorbid diseases, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, urinary diversion 
method, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative 
pathology and follow-up results. Results: A total of 24 patients were enrolled 
in this study, and 18(75%) were male and 6(25%) were female. The age was 
(40.4±3.5) years and the BMI was (24.7±2.5) kg/m2. At initial visit, there were 
19(79%) patients who presented with hematuria, 4 (17%) with lower urinary tract 
symptoms, and 1(4%) was discovered by routine examination. Fifteen (62%) 
patients had single tumor, and 9(38%) had multiple tumors. The tumor diameter of 
14(58%) patients were ≥3 cm and 3(13%) patients were combined with 
hydronephrosis. All patients received robot-assisted radical cystectomy 
successfully. The operative time was (325.8±57.2) min, and the blood loss during 
operation was 200(162,300) ml. The duration of postoperative hospital stay was 
11(9,22) days. And according to different urinary diversion methods, 17(80%) 
patients had ileal orthotopic neobladder and 7(20%) had ileal conduit. For 
patients whose sexual nerves were preserved, 6(6/9) recovered their sexual 
function after one year of the surgery. The final pathological results showed 
that 16(67%) patients were in T2 stage, 7(29%) patients were in T3 stage and 
that 1(4%) patient in T4 stage. There were 6 (25%) patients with lymphatic 
metastasis, 8(33%) with low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, 14(58%) with 
high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, 1(4%) with adenocarcinoma and 1(4%) 
with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Early complications of the patients 
were mostly slight, and only 2(8%) patients had Clavien Ⅲdegree complications, 
while few patients had late complications. The follow-up time was (26±12) 
months. During the follow-up time, there was 1(4%) patient who died because of 
liver and kidney failure. Distant metastasis occurred in 4(17%) cases and 1(4%) 
patient had urothelial carcinoma on one side of the ureter. Lymphatic metastasis 
(P=0.018) and ≥ T3 (P=0.038) stage were associated with the prognosis. 
Conclusions: For young patients with muscular invasive bladder cancer, the major 
initial presentation is hematuria, and most of them have advanced tumor stage 
and high malignant degree. Robot-assisted radical cystectomy is a safe and 
effective operation method with less postoperative complications, and protecting 
sexual nerve contributes to the recovery of sexual function. Advanced tumor 
stage (≥T3) and lymphatic metastasis are associated with distant metastasis and 
recurrence.

BACKGROUND: The impact of neobladder and urostomy on bladder cancer patient's 
health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is controversial and many issues 
currently remain under-investigated. Initial studies pointed out that the 
emotional responses of caregivers might be 'contagious', influencing emotional 
reactions in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy.
METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-two bladder cancer patients (aged M = 67.29 
years; SD = 9.23) (16.9% (65) were female and 82.9% (319) were male) and their 
caregivers were enrolled. Data were collected prospectively: at T0 (1 month 
before the surgery), at T1 (2 weeks after the surgery, at patient discharge from 
the hospital) and at T2 (6-month follow-up). At each time point (T0, T1 and T2), 
a set of questionnaires (EORT QLQ-C30 and emotion thermometer) were given to 
patients and their caregivers.
RESULTS: All patients reported a general improvement in the HR-QoL and global 
health status/QoL from T0 to T2 (p < 0.001). No significant differences were 
observed between neobladder and urostomy. At T0, the emotional thermometer total 
scoring in caregivers was positive in relation to HR-QoL (p < 0.001) and 
negative in relation to the patient's perception of QoL (p < 0.001) and global 
health (p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed at T1 and T2.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients and their caregiver's emotional 
reactions to cancer are deep-rooted and strongly interconnected, and they 
provide innovative insights for the clinical management of bladder cancer 
patients.

Background: We aimed to compare the oncologic outcomes of intracorporeal urinary 
diversion (ICUD) and extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) following 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in patients diagnosed with bladder 
cancer. Materials and Methods: Medical records of 730 patients who underwent 
RARC between April 2007 and May 2019 in 11 tertiary referral centers were 
retrospectively reviewed. We assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS), 
cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in the two groups 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression models were used to identify 
factors associated with RFS, CSS, and OS. Results: Among 591 patients, 
neobladder diversion was performed more frequently in the ICUD group (70.8% vs 
52.5%, p = 0.001). The median follow-up duration was shorter in the ICUD group 
than in the ECUD group (16 vs 26 months, p < 0.001). The rates of overall 
recurrence (36.5% vs 25.5%, p = 0.013) and pelvic recurrence (12.1% vs 5.9%, 
p = 0.031) were higher in the ECUD group. However, no differences in 5-year RFS 
(43.2% vs 58.4%, p = 0.516), CSS (79.3% vs 89.7%, p = 0.392), and OS (74.3% vs 
81.4%, p = 0.411) were noted between the two groups. Multivariable analysis 
revealed that when compared to ICUD, ECUD was not associated with RFS (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.982; p = 0.920), CSS (HR, 0.568; p = 0.126), and OS (HR, 0.642; 
p = 0.124). Conclusion: Although there was a difference in recurrence rate 
between the two groups, multivariable analysis indicated that the diversion 
technique after RARC did not affect the oncologic outcomes. Large prospective 
studies with long-term follow-up are warranted to verify the oncologic outcomes 
of ICUD and ECUD following RARC.

Ileal neobladder construction is a common treatment for patients with bladder 
cancer after radical cystectomy. However, metabolic disorders caused by 
transposed bowel segments occur frequently. Bladder tissue engineering is a 
promising alternative approach. Although numerous studies have reported bladder 
reconstruction using acellular and cellular scaffolds, there are also 
disadvantages associated with these methods, such as immunogenicity of synthetic 
grafts and incompatible mechanical properties of the biomaterials. Here, we 
engineered an autologous peritoneal graft consisting of a peritoneal sheet and 
the seromuscular layer from the ileum. Three months after the surgery, compared 
with the neobladder made from the ileum, the reconstructed neobladder using our 
new method showed normal function and better gross morphological 
characteristics. Moreover, histopathological and transcriptomic analysis 
revealed urothelium-like cells expressing urothelial biomarkers appeared in the 
neobladder, while no such changes were observed in the control group. Overall, 
our study provides a new strategy for bladder tissue engineering and informs a 
variety of future research prospects.

ABSTRACT: To review the most used intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder 
(ICONB) after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and create a unified 
compendium of the different alternatives, including new consistent images.
METHODS: We performed a non-systematic review of the literature with the 
keywords "bladder cancer", "urinary diversion", "radical cystectomy", and 
"neobladder".
RESULTS: Forty studies were included in the analysis. The most frequent type of 
ICONB was the modified Studer "U" neobladder (70%) followed by the Hautmann "W" 
modified neobladder (7.5%), the "Y" neobladder (5%), and the Padua neobladder 
(5%). The operative time to perform a urinary diversion ranged from 124 to 553 
min. The total estimated blood loss ranged from 200 to 900 mL. The rate of 
positive surgical margins ranged from 0% to 8.1%. Early minor and major 
complication rates ranged from 0% to 100% and from 0% to 33%, respectively. Late 
minor and major complication rates ranged from 0% to 70% and from 0% to 25%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The most frequent types of ICONB are Studer "U" neobladder, Hautmann 
"W" neobladder, "Y" neobladder, and the Padua neobladder. Randomized studies 
comparing the performance of the different types of ICONB, the performance in an 
intra or extracorporeal manner, or the performance of an ICONB versus ICIC are 
lacking in the literature. To this day, there are not sufficient quality data to 
determine the supremacy of one technique. This manuscript represents a 
compendium of the most used ICONB with detailed descriptions of the technical 
aspects, operative and perioperative outcomes, and new consistent images of each 
technique.

OBJECTIVE: To review the most used robot-assisted cutaneous urinary diversion 
(CUD) after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and create a unified 
compendium of the different alternatives, including new consistent images.
METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature with the keywords "bladder 
cancer", "cutaneous urinary diversion", and "radical cystectomy" was performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies of intracorporeal ileal conduit (ICIC) and two of 
intracorporeal Indiana pouch (ICIP) were included in the analysis. Regarding 
ICIC, the patients' age ranged from 60 to 76 years. The operative time to 
perform a urinary diversion ranged from 60 to 133 min. The total estimated blood 
loss ranged from 200 to 1 117 mL. The rate of positive surgical margins ranged 
from 0% to 14.3%. Early minor and major complication rates ranged from 0% to 
71.4% and from 0% to 53.4%, respectively. Late minor and major complication 
rates ranged from 0% to 66% and from 0% to 32%, respectively. Totally ICIP data 
are limited to one case report and one clinical series.
CONCLUSION: The most frequent type of CUD is ICIC. Randomized studies comparing 
the performance of the different types of CUD, the performance in an intra- or 
extracorporeal manner, or the performance of a CUD versus orthotopic ileal 
neobladder are lacking in the literature. To this day, there are not enough 
quality data to determine the supremacy of one technique. This manuscript 
represents a compendium of the most used CUD with detailed descriptions of the 
technical aspects, operative and perioperative outcomes, and new consistent 
images for each technique.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a narrative overview of contemporary surgical management 
of muscle-invasive bladder cancer with focus on radical cystectomy and urinary 
tract reconstruction.
DATA SOURCES: International guidelines and a search for articles in PubMed, 
Medline, and Cochrane Database for single and collaborative studies on surgical 
management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with muscle invasive bladder cancer often have 
complex treatment and care needs. For those who undergo radical cystectomy as 
the curative treatment, there is a considerable risk of general complications 
after major surgery and short- and long-term complications specific to 
reconstruction of the urinary tract after radical cystectomy. Contemporary care 
focuses on perioperative optimization to lower rates of major complications, 
enhanced recovery protocols, and focus on rehabilitation and cancer 
survivorship.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses are integral members of the 
multidisciplinary team around patients undergoing surgery for muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer, and are in a position to coordinate pathways for these patients 
who often have complex care needs because of preexisting comorbidity and limited 
personal resources that impede recovery after major surgery and cancer 
survivorship.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To study the cumulative incidence and surgical 
treatment of midline incisional hernia (MIH) after cystectomy for bladder 
cancer.
METHODS: In the nationwide Bladder Cancer Data Base Sweden (BladderBaSe), 
cystectomy was performed in 5646 individuals. Cumulative incidence MIH and 
surgery for MIH were investigated in relation to age, gender, comorbidity, 
previous laparotomy and/or inguinal hernia repair, operative technique, 
primary/secondary cystectomy, postoperative wound dehiscence, year of surgery, 
and period-specific mean annual hospital cystectomy volume (PSMAV).
RESULTS: Three years after cystectomy the cumulative incidence of MIH and 
surgery for MIH was 8% and 4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence MIH was 
12%, 9% and 7% in patients having urinary diversion with continent cutaneous 
pouch, orthotopic neobladder and ileal conduit. Patients with postoperative 
wound dehiscence had a higher three-year cumulative incidence MIH (20%) compared 
to 8% without. The corresponding cumulative incidence surgery for MIH three 
years after cystectomy was 9%, 6%, and 4% for continent cutaneous, neobladder, 
and conduit diversion, respectively, and 11% for individuals with postoperative 
wound dehiscence (vs 4% without). Using multivariable Cox regression, secondary 
cystectomy (HR 1.3 (1.0-1.7)), continent cutaneous diversion (HR 1.9 (1.1-2.4)), 
robot-assisted cystectomy (HR 1.8 (1-3.2)), wound dehiscence (HR 3.0 (2.0-4.7)), 
cystectomy in hospitals with PSMAV 10-25 (HR 1.4 (1.0-1.9)), as well as 
cystectomy during later years (HRs 2.5-3.1) were all independently associated 
with increased risk of MIH.
CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of MIH was 8% three years postoperatively, 
and increase over time. Avoiding postoperative wound dehiscence after midline 
closure is important to decrease the risk of MIH.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the health-related quality of life reported by 
patients who received an ileal conduit (IC), Indiana pouch, or neobladder 
urinary diversion after radical cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Vanderbilt 
Cystectomy Index survey was administered to patients with bladder cancer 
undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion from 2015-2018. Surveys were 
completed prior to radical cystectomy and then longitudinally throughout the 
postoperative course.
RESULTS: A total of 146 patients completed questionnaires over a median of 12.3 
months, 83 (56.8%) received an IC, 31 (21.2%) an Indiana pouch, and 32 (21.9%) 
an orthotopic neobladder. There were no significant differences in health 
related quality of life among urinary diversion groups considering the Trial 
Outcome Index scores, general overall FACT-G assessment, or total Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Vanderbilt Cystectomy Index instruments. Patients 
who received IC were older and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p 
<.005) yet still experienced similar improvements in health related quality of 
life commensurate with the other diversion cohorts. There was a significant 
difference in physical well-being favoring neobladder over IC or Indiana Pouch 
urinary diversions (p <.05).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first and largest quality of life 
analysis comparing all three methods of urinary diversion in a longitudinal 
fashion utilizing a standardized, validated, treatment-specific health survey. 
Proper preoperative counseling is critical to ensure understanding of the 
benefits of available urinary diversion.

A 56-year-old man presented to our hospital with melena, and was diagnosed as 
having locally advanced sigmoid colon cancer invading the trigone of the 
bladder(cT4bN0M0). mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab was administered as a preoperative 
chemotherapy. After 6 courses of administration, the main tumor shrunk but the 
bladder invasion remained. We explained to the patient that resection of the 
bladder was necessary for radical treatment of the tumor. As he refused a 
urostomy for urinary reconstruction, we chose ileal neobladder reconstruction 
and performed lower anterior resection plus total cystectomy, which resulted in 
pathologically curative resection. No recurrence and almost no urinary 
incontinence occurred during the 8 months after the operation. Although further 
follow-up is required, our present case indicates that ileal neobladder may be a 
useful reconstruction option for patients with locally advanced colorectal 
cancer who undergo total cystectomy.

Background: The injection of hydrogel in between the anterior rectal wall and 
prostate protects the rectum from the radiation field in men undergoing 
radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Multicenter prospective trials have 
demonstrated safety of the material, and that liquefication and reabsorption of 
the material occur roughly 12 weeks after injection. Other studies have noted 
the presence of the hydrogel up to 24 weeks after injection and documented 
significant complications with its use. In this study we discuss a patient in 
whom hydrogel was discovered in the anterior rectal wall who was undergoing 
radical cystoprostatectomy 32 weeks after injection, and how this precluded 
creation of a neobladder. Case Presentation: A 64-year-old Caucasian man with a 
history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension was diagnosed with unfavorable 
intermediate risk prostate cancer. He underwent injection of hydrogel followed 
by radiotherapy. He subsequently developed hematuria and carcinoma in situ and 
high grade T1 nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer were diagnosed. Thirty-two weeks 
later, he underwent robot-assisted radical cystoprostatectomy. The patient was 
originally planned for neobladder creation but intraoperative findings of 
persistent hydrogel in between rectum and prostate precluded this reconstruction 
and necessitated construction of an ileal conduit. Conclusion: Urologists should 
be aware of the fact that SpaceOAR hydrogel can persist beyond the expected 12- 
to 24-week dissolution period. In a patient who requires a radical cystectomy, 
the persistent presence of that gel may preclude the creation of a neobladder. 
Preoperative imaging to identify persistence vs dissolution of the gel would 
facilitate better preoperative patient counseling.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion (UD), with either an 
ileal conduit (IC) or an orthotopic neobladder (NB), is a complex surgery, in 
which various complications can occur. In this study, we compared postoperative 
complication rates after a RC and UD performed for the treatment of 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer or recurring high-risk non-muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer in our center.
METHODS: We retrospectively included 604 patients that underwent UDs from 
December 1996 to August 2015. Complications were classified by type and severity 
according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were performed to identify predictive factors of short-term (≤30 d), 
intermediate-term (31-90 d), and long-term (>90 d) complications.
RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-five (74%) and 159 (26%) patients received ICs 
and NBs, respectively. These groups had significantly different long-term 
complication rates (IC: 39.7% vs. NB: 49%, P=0.046), but similar short-term 
(P=0.319) and intermediate-term complication rates (P=0.397). Short-term 
complications (CDC I-V) were predicted by male gender, age-adjusted Charlson 
comorbidity index (aCCI) ≥3, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
score ≥3. Compared to minor short-term complications (CDC I-II), major 
short-term complications (CDC III-V) were predicted by male gender and a 
previous abdominal/pelvic surgery, and long-term major complications were 
predicted by the type of UD (NB).
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing risk of short-term complications with increasing 
aCCI and ASA score can be used when counseling the patients who are planned to 
undergo a RC with UD. Patients that receive NBs should be informed of the 
increased risk of reoperations compared to an IC.

BACKGROUND: Bladder tumors in pregnancy are extremely rare. No more than 50 
cases have been published to date, including all histologic variants, and only 
three cases of bladder squamous cell carcinoma have been described.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a clinical case of a 31-year-old woman with 
bladder squamous cell carcinoma in the second trimester of pregnancy. After a 
C-section at 30 weeks, we performed radical cystectomy with extended bilateral 
lymphadenectomy, hysterectomy and right oophorectomy. The Studer neobladder 
technique was performed for urinary tract reconstruction. Definitive pathology 
showed invasive bladder squamous cell carcinoma, Grade 2, with microscopic 
infiltration of the perivesical fat, negative margins, and 3/28 lymph nodes with 
carcinoma (pT3aN2M0). The patient underwent 18 months of surveillance after 
radical cystectomy, without recurrence by PET-CT.
CONCLUSIONS: Bladder cancer in pregnant women is extremely rare but must be 
considered in those with recurrent gross hematuria and/or recurrent urinary 
tract infection. To our knowledge, this case involves the longest 
recurrence-free survival of a pregnant woman with squamous cell bladder cancer 
published thus far.

PURPOSE: In this first-in-human phase I study (NCT02132754), we explored MK-4166 
[humanized IgG1 agonist mAb targeting glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor 
(GITR)] with and without pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: MK-4166 was tested alone (0.0015-900 mg i.v. every 3 weeks 
for four doses) or with pembrolizumab (200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks for ≤35 doses) 
in patients with metastatic solid tumors (dose escalation/confirmation) and 
advanced melanoma (expansion). Primary objectives were to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability and establish the MTD of MK-4166. Exploratory endpoints were 
objective response rate (ORR) and T cell-inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) 
analysis using RNA from baseline tumor samples.
RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were enrolled [monotherapy, n = 48; combination 
therapy, n = 65 (20 in the expansion)]. Forty-six patients (40.7%) had grade ≥3 
adverse events, 9 (8.0%) of which were treatment related. No treatment-related 
deaths were observed. One dose-limiting toxicity event with monotherapy (bladder 
perforation in patient with neobladder) was considered related to study drug. 
MTD was not reached. MK-4166 pharmacodynamics showed decreased GITR availability 
on circulating T cells with increasing doses. One objective response (ORR, 2.2%) 
was achieved with combination therapy in the dose escalation/confirmation (n = 
45). In the expansion, 8 of 13 patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI)-naïve melanoma achieved a response (ORR, 62%; 95% confidence interval, 
32-86; 5 complete responses and 3 partial responses). None of the ICI-pretreated 
patients (n = 7) responded. High response rates were observed in ICI-naïve 
patients irrespective of GEP status.
CONCLUSIONS: MK-4166 900 mg i.v. every 3 weeks as monotherapy and with 
pembrolizumab was tolerable. Responses were observed with combination therapy, 
mostly in patients with ICI-naïve melanoma.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of catheterisation and urinary 
retention in male patients with bladder cancer after radical cystectomy (RC) and 
orthotopic neobladder (ONB) and to identify potential predictors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an Institutional Review Board approved, 
prospectively maintained bladder cancer database, we collected information using 
a diversion-related questionnaire from 299 consecutive male patients with 
bladder cancer upon postoperative clinic visit. Urinary retention was defined as 
≥3 catheterisations/day or a self-reported inability to void without a catheter. 
Uni- and multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to identify 
predictors of catheterisation and urinary retention.
RESULTS: Self-catheterisation was reported in 51 patients (17%), of whom, 22 
(7.4% of the total patients) were in retention. Freedom from any catheterisation 
at 3, 5, and 10 years after RC was 85%, 77%, and 62%, respectively. Freedom from 
retention at 3, 5, and 10 years after RC was 93%, 88%, and 79%, respectively. 
Multivariable Cox regression showed that higher body mass index (BMI; ≥27 kg/m2 
) significantly increased the need for catheterisation (hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-4.32) as well as retention (HR 5.20, 95% CI 
1.74-15.51). Greater medical comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥2) 
correlated with the need for any catheterisation (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.02-3.3), but 
not retention. Pathological stage and type of diversion were not significant 
predictors of the need to catheterise or urinary retention.
CONCLUSION: In males undergoing RC with ONB, retention requiring catheterisation 
to void is uncommon. Patients with a BMI of ≥27 kg/m2 are at significantly 
increased risk of retention and need for self-catheterisation.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the structures around the vesicourethral junction and 
to improve functional outcomes after nerve-sparing radical cystectomy with 
orthotopic urinary diversion for female patients, we histologically elucidated 
the fibromuscular construction and nerve distribution around the vesicourethral 
junction.
METHODS: Pelvic specimens containing all the pelvic viscera were obtained from 
33 donated female cadavers. Macroslices that included the urethra, the anterior 
wall of the vagina, and the inferomedial edge of the levator ani muscle were 
made and performed elastica Masson and immunohistochemical staining. The 
intraoperative findings were collected in 3 female patients undergoing 
nerve-sparing radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: In 18 out of the 33 cadavers, smooth muscle mass occupied a space 
between the urethra and the inferomedial edge of the levator ani muscle and 
covered the inferior margin of the bladder detrusor. We termed this mass the 
hiatal smooth muscle. The detrusor nerves entered the bladder, and the cavernous 
and sphincter nerves ran between the hiatal smooth muscle and vesicourethral 
junction. The boundary between hiatal smooth muscle and urethral smooth muscle 
was easily distinguished intraoperatively during dissection of the 
vesicourethral junction.
CONCLUSION: We found that more than half of elderly women have hiatal smooth 
muscle between the urethra and inferior edge of the levator ani. Autonomic nerve 
fibers innervating the urethral sphincter, run between the hiatal smooth muscle 
and vesicourethral junction in female cadavers with hiatal smooth muscle. When 
performing female radical cystectomy before neobladder reconstruction, nerve 
sparing can be reliably performed using the hiatal smooth muscle as a landmark.

A 26-year-old man visited our hospital with a complaint of macrohematuria. 
Cystoscopy revealed a nodular tumor around the right ureteral orifice. 
Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed, and the tumor was 
pathologically diagnosed as the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma (NVUC). 
Radical cystectomy and modified Studer orthotopic neobladder reconstruction were 
performed. The pathological stage was pT2a, pN2. The patient received 2 courses 
of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and cisplatin. The patient is 
currently free from disease at 31 months after the treatment. To our knowledge, 
this case report represents the youngest case of NVUC.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the occurrence of emptying dysfunction between surgical 
techniques for orthotopic neobladder suspended with round ligament (rONB) and 
the standard procedure (sONB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective randomised controlled trial was performed in 
a single centre of female patients undergoing creation of an ONB using rONB or 
sONB. Patients were followed for ≥24 months after ONB. The primary endpoints 
were significant post-void residual urine volume (sPVR) and need for clean 
intermittent catheterisation (CIC) at 24 months postoperatively. The secondary 
endpoints included early and late complications, urodynamic profile, and ONB 
continence.
RESULTS: Between January 2011 and October 2017, the trial enrolled 85 patients, 
of whom 82 were randomised. A total of 41 patients had a rONB and 41 a sONB. At 
24 months, 17 of the 37 patients with a sONB and nine of the 39 patients with a 
rONB had a sPVR. The cumulative risk of a sPVR was significantly lower in the 
rONB group (23.1%) vs the sONB group (45.9%) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.96; P = 0.040). In all, 15 of the 37 patients 
with a sONB and four of the 39 patients with a rONB needed CIC. The cumulative 
risk of requiring CIC was significantly lower in the rONB group (10.3%) vs the 
sONB group (40.5%) (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.67; P = 0.008) at 24 months. 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis also showed that the rONB type was an 
independently protective factor for sPVR and CIC. The rates of early (0-90 days) 
and late complication (>90 days) were 54.1% and 13.5% in the sONB group, and 
64.1% and 10.3% in the rONB group, respectively. There were no significant 
differences in complications, urodynamic profile or ONB continence. A major 
limitation is the small sample size at a single centre.
CONCLUSION: Posterior support with round ligament for an ONB significantly 
improved the emptying of the ONB and resulted in a reduced need for CIC. The 
surgical modification is a feasible and safe technique without additional 
complication-related surgeries.

    Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2021 Jan;31(1):11.

Pelvic exenteration combines multiple organ resections and functional 
reconstruction. Many techniques have been described for urinary reconstruction, 
although only a few are routinely used. The aim of this review is to focus 
beyond the technical aspects and the advantages and disadvantages of each 
technique, and to include a critical analysis of continent techniques in the 
gynecologic and urologic literature. Selecting a technique for urinary 
reconstruction must take into account the constraints entailed by the natural 
history of the disease, patient characteristics, healthcare institution, and 
surgeon experience. In gynecologic oncology, the Bricker ileal conduit is the 
most commonly employed diversion, followed by the self-catheterizable pouch and 
orthotopic bladder replacement. Continent and non-continent diversions present 
similar immediate and long-term complication rates, including lower tract 
urinary infections and pyelonephritis (5-50%), ureteral stricture (3-27%), 
urolithiasis (5-25%), urinary fistula (5%), and more rarely, vitamin B12 
deficiency and metabolic acidosis. Urinary incontinence for the ileal orthotopic 
neobladder (50%), stoma-related complications for the Bricker ileal conduit 
(24%), difficulty with self-catheterization (18%) for the continent pouch, and 
induction of secondary malignancy for the ureterosigmoidostomy (3%) are the most 
relevant technique-related complications following urinary diversion. The 
self-catheterizable pouch and orthotopic bladder require a longer learning curve 
from the surgical team and demand adaptation from the patient compared with the 
ileal conduit. Quality of life between different techniques remains 
controversial, although it would seem that young patients may benefit from 
continent diversions. We consider that centralization of pelvic exenteration in 
referral centers is crucial to optimize the oncologic and functional outcomes of 
complex ablative reconstructive surgery.

Over the last decade, the increased utilization of robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) in the surgical treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
has led to an uptrend in intracorporeal urinary diversions (ICUD). However, the 
operative results comparing ICUD to extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) have 
varied widely. We performed a meta-analysis to analyze perioperative outcomes 
and complications of ICUD compared to ECUD following RARC. This study is 
registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
(PROSPERO) CRD42020164074. A systematic literature review was conducted using 
PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases in August 2019. A total of six studies 
comparing ICUD vs ECUD were identified and meta-analysis was conducted on these 
studies. In addition, a cumulative analysis was also performed on 83 studies 
that reported perioperative outcomes after RARC and ICUD or ECUD. The Weighed 
Mean Difference of operative time and blood loss between ICUD and ECUD group was 
(16; 95% confidence interval - 34 to 66) and (- 86; 95% confidence interval 
- 124 to - 48), respectively. ICUD and ECUD had comparable early (30-day) and 
mid-term (30-90-day) complication rate (RR 1.19; 95% confidence interval 
0.71-2.0; p = 0.5) and (RR 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.71-1.15 p = 0.4) 
respectively. In the 83 studies that were included in the cumulative analysis, 
the mean operative time for ileal conduit and neobladders by ICUD were 307 and 
428 min, respectively, compared to ECUD 428 and 426 min, respectively. ICUD and 
ECUD have comparable short- and mid-term complication rate. The ICUD group has 
lower blood loss and lower rate of blood transfusion compared to ECUD.

PURPOSE: To evaluate early continence of patients who underwent inpatient 
rehabilitation after radical cystectomy (RC) and orthotopic bladder substitution 
(ONB).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on the data of 283 patients who 
underwent a three weeks inpatient rehabilitation after RC and ONB for bladder 
cancer between January 2016 and July 2017. All patients were treated with a 
special multimodal continence therapy. The continence status was evaluated by 
measuring urine loss by a 24-h pad test and urine volume on uroflowmetry at the 
beginning (T1) and at the end (T2) of inpatient rehabilitation. Multivariate 
linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of 
urine loss.
RESULTS: Median patient age was 63 years. NS was documented for 142 patients 
(50.2%). Median urine loss decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the 24-h pad 
test, from 442 gm at T1 (median 29 days after surgery) to 88 gm at T2 (median 
50 days after surgery). Urine volume increased significantly (p < 0.001) from a 
median of 78 ml at T1 to a median of 157 ml at T2. Age (p = 0.002), diabetes 
(p = 0.031), obesity (p = 0.003), and nerve sparing (p = 0.011) were identified 
as independent predictors for urine loss at the end of inpatient rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: Continence improved significantly during the three weeks of 
inpatient rehabilitation. Younger age, the absence of diabetes or obesity, and 
NS resulted in better continence in the early postoperative period after ONB.

BACKGROUND: Intracorporeal urinary diversion is considered to be effective in 
improving intestinal function recovery and reducing the occurrence of early 
complications after radical cystectomy. Almost all neobladders constructed via 
intracorporeal laparoscopy have used the ileum.
OBJECTIVE: To present our intracorporeal detaenial sigmoid neobladder technique 
that replicates open surgery principles and to present oncological and 
functional outcomes and complication rates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a case series from a single tertiary 
referral hospital from September 11, 2018 to April 19, 2019, including 12 
selected patients with pathologically confirmed muscle-invasive or refractory 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy including pelvic lymph-node 
dissection and intracorporeal detaenial sigmoid neobladder, which is 
demonstrated in the accompanying video.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were collected. 
Perioperative outcomes and 1-yr oncological and functional outcomes are 
reported.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: All surgeries were successful without severe 
complications or conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time (± standard 
deviation) was 414.6 ± 52.2 min, with 33.8 ± 6.80 min for neobladder 
construction. Surgical margins and lymph nodes were all negative for metastasis. 
All patients were encouraged to do ambulation exercise 1 d after surgery, and 
oral liquid intake was resumed between days 2 and 4. However, because this was a 
retrospective study in a single centre with very few cases, it is difficult to 
reach a definitive conclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracorporeal detaenial sigmoid neobladder is technically feasible 
with no need for additional medical equipment. Encouraging outcomes were 
observed during short-term follow-up. This approach could represent another 
alternative choice for patients undergoing laparoscopic radical cystectomy. 
Longer-term follow-up data are needed to evaluate oncological and functional 
outcomes.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We describe our stepwise technique for intracorporeal detaenial 
sigmoid neobladder while replicating established open surgery principles. In 
addition to retaining the advantages of a neobladder, better postoperative 
recovery is achieved.

INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
neobladder formation is a complex surgical procedure.
AIM: To describe the main stages of RARC and to analyze its short-term results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RARC with ileocystoplasty was performed in 16 patients, 
most of whom were men (n=14). In 15 patients, the indication for surgery was 
bladder cancer (BCa), while one patient has radiation-induced sigmoid fistula 
with a formation of small, contracted bladder. During radical cystectomy (RC), 
the lower ureters were dissected, followed by posterior dissection of the 
bladder with mobilization from both sides to the pelvic fascia, clipping and 
transection of the vesical pedicles, and suturing of the dorsal venous complex 
with urethral dissection. After pelvic lymph node dissection, 40 cm of the ileum 
was resected, after that two distal segments of 15 cm were U-shaped, and a 1.5 
cm incision was made in the lower part of the bowel, followed by a formation of 
the urethral anastomosis. Then bowel segments were detubularized, and continuous 
suture on the posterior and anterior walls of the neobladder was done. Ureters 
were implanted in the proximal tubular part of the resected colon according to 
the Nesbit technique.
RESULTS: The mean operation time was 380 minutes. The blood loss ranged from 80 
to 200 ml; however, blood transfusion was not performed. Complications during 
30-days after RARC were observed in 7 (43.7%) patients, including 4 (25%) of 
class I-II according to Clavien - Dindo, and 3 (18.7%) of class III-IV. In 
patients with leakage at the uretero- intestinal anastomosis (n=2) and 
urethro-neobladder anastomosis (n=1), percutaneous drainage was performed, which 
allowed to resolve these complications. There were no cases of bowel 
obstruction. One patient with gastrointestinal bleeding required blood 
transfusion. The 90-day late complications occurred in 6 (37.5%) patients, 
including 2 cases of upper urinary tract infection. One patient died of acute 
myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION: RARC is a contemporary minimally invasive method for muscle-invasive 
BCa. Stepwise approach to RARC with intracorporeal neobladder formation may 
reduce the operation time and the rate of complications.

A Narrative Inquiry into the Adjustment Experiences of Male Bladder Cancer 
Survivors with a Neobladder.

(3)Department of English, Hanyang Women's University, Seoul 04763, Korea.

This study aimed to explore three male bladder cancer survivors' adjustment 
experiences after neobladder reconstruction. A narrative inquiry method was 
adopted to closely investigate the individual experiences of bladder cancer 
survivors and the meaning of their experiences. Three themes emerged regarding 
physical and mental changes resulting from neobladder reconstruction: difficulty 
urinating or holding urine, sexual dysfunction and sexlessness, and stress 
resulting from urinary incontinence. Life changes following surgery varied 
across each participant and included 'unwanted retirement', 'quitting drinking 
and leaving work', and 'beginning of a restrained life'. The theme of adjustment 
experience emerged, comprising 'active exploration of resolutions', 'accepting 
change and partial return to daily life', and 'living in line with the health 
condition and family wishes'. Bladder cancer survivors with a neobladder, in 
this study, continue to adjust to changes in the voiding mechanism, various 
symptoms including incontinence, and life changes even after surgical cancer 
resection. The findings suggest that not only therapeutic interventions, but 
additional interventions are also needed to assist bladder cancer survivors with 
adjustment, rehabilitation, and return to society. These findings are also 
expected to be used both to educate bladder cancer survivors with a neobladder 
and to develop policies to help them.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the functional outcomes and complications of modified 
Hautmann neobladder with Wallace ureteroileal anastomosis on a 6-8 cm long 
isoperistaltic chimney, following radical cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2015 and October 2019, 22 patients (18 
men and 4 women) underwent radical cystectomy and Hautmann neobladder 
reconstruction with chimney modification and Wallace I ureteroileal anastomosis. 
The mean age of patients was 61 years (45-74 years). All procedures were 
performed by the same surgeon and the mean follow-up was 29.4 months. 
Complications were registered as early (occurring within 3 months) or late 
(occurring after 3 months), with particular attention addressed to the 
ureteroileal anastomotic stricture and anastomotic leakage rate. Patient 
evaluation also included symptom analysis for daytime continence and voiding 
frequency.
RESULTS: Ureteroileal anastomotic stricture was not detected as a cause of 
hydronephrosis. Hovewer, the anastomotic leakage occurred in one patient during 
the early postoperative period. Early complications occurred in 9 patients and 
the most common was bilateral hydronephrosis, detected in 5 examinees. Late 
complications occurred in 4 patients. Complete daytime and nighttime continence 
achieved in 18 and 16 patients respectively, with two patients (9%) still 
required intermittent catheterization three months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The functional results with modified Hautmann neobladder, 
incorporating short afferent limb in Wallace I uretero-enteric anastomosis, were 
efficient. This technique is an effective way to minimize potential 
uretero-enteric stricture, anastomotic leakage and incidence of vesicoureteral 
reflux.

The main treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer is radical cystectomy with 
creation of an artificial intestinal bladder with restoration of transurethral 
urination is recognized as the best method of urine derivation. Aim - to study 
the urodynamic features of the artificial bladder. The main study group 
consisted of 57 patients with invasive bladder cancer who underwent radical 
cystoprostatectomy with ileocystoplasty in several specialized centers. The 
artificial bladder, formed from the terminal ileum, shows the original results 
of an urodynamic study, not similar to the data obtained with various 
pathologies of the bladder. Patients with severe atony of the neobladder were 
noted, which potentiated chronic mycotic insufficiency with elements of 
obstruction and required periodic catheterization. Some patients whose main 
complaint was urinary incontinence in the daytime and at night, according to the 
KUDI, demonstrated elements of the lack of overactivity, which can also be the 
cause of incontinence and requires further study of pathogenetic features and 
possible correction methods.

PURPOSE: To present surgical methods and outcomes in women with bladder cancer 
(BCa) requiring correction of neobladder-vaginal fistula (NVF) after radical 
cystectomy (RC) with ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 163 women who underwent RC with 
IONB for BCa between January 2010 and December 2018 were retrospectively 
reviewed. The presence of NVF was confirmed by cystoscopy and/or voiding 
cystography. NVF repair was performed using a transvaginal approach, which 
included circumferential incision of the fistula tract, creation of a plane 
between the neobladder serosa and the vaginal epithelium, and multi-layered 
transvaginal closure.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 47.9 months, NVF was identified in 12 
(8.8%) of the 163 included women. Eight (66.7%) fistulas were located in the 
proximal anterior vaginal wall and four (33.3%) in the vaginal apex. Median time 
from RC to NVF repair was 3.4 months (range, 2.1-5.6 months), median NVF size 
was 6.0 mm (range, 4.0-22.0 mm), and median duration of urethral Foley catheter 
indwelling was 24.0 days (range, 15.0-43.0 days). Initial repair of NVF was 
successful in ten (83.3%) patients. Two (16.7%) patients who relapsed retained 
IONB through the subsequent operation. Two (16.7%) patients developed severe 
urinary incontinence after NVF repair, requiring anti-incontinence surgery with 
a synthetic transobturator mid-urethral sling.
CONCLUSION: The transvaginal approach for NVF repair is feasible, yielding 
successful surgical outcomes. However, women should be counseled about the risks 
of relapse and urinary incontinence.

York, USA.

Background: There are many nonmalignant complications after urinary 
reconstruction. Anastomotic strictures and redundancy of an ileal chimney are 
such. A patient with both issues might necessitate an open surgical approach; 
yet endoscopic techniques are more attractive for these older frail patients. 
Case Presentation: A 61-year-old woman with a history of bladder cancer who 
underwent radical cystectomy and neobladder creation now develops left 
hydronephrosis and a redundant ileal chimney with severe metabolic acidosis. She 
underwent endoscopic creation of a neochimneycystotomy. Conclusion: The 
refinement of endoscopic techniques moves the field of surgery away from open 
surgery, which is beneficial for patients. This endoscopic technique treated the 
anastomotic stricture as well as redundant ileal chimney in a novel way that has 
not been reported previously in the literature.

PURPOSE: Ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB) reconstruction is the preferred 
urinary diversion among selected patients who have undergone radical cystectomy 
(RC) for bladder cancer (BCa). There is insufficient data regarding patients' 
quality of life (QoL), sexual and urinary outcomes. Our objectives were to 
assess QoL in a multicentre cohort study, and to identify related clinical, 
oncological and functional factors.
METHODS: Patients who underwent RC with IONB reconstruction for BCa from 2010 to 
2017 at one of the three French hospitals completed the following self-reported 
questionnaires: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) generic (QLQ-C30) and bladder cancer specific instruments (QLQ-BLM30). 
To assess urinary symptoms, patients completed the Urinary Symptom Profile 
questionnaire (USP) and a three-day voiding diary. Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were computed to identify clinical, pathological, and functional 
predictors of global QoL score.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients completed questionnaires. The median age was 
64 years and 86.3% were men. The median interval between surgery and responses 
to questionnaires was 36 months (range 12-96). Fifty-five percent of patients 
presented a high global QoL (EORTC-QLQC30, median score 75). A pre-RC American 
Society of Anesthesiologists score > 2, active neoplasia, sexual inactivity, and 
stress urinary incontinence were associated with a worse QoL. After a 
multivariate analysis, sexual inactivity was the only independent factor related 
to an altered QoL.
CONCLUSION: Patients with IONB reconstruction after RC have a high global QoL. 
Sexual activity could independently impact the global QoL, and it should be 
assessed pre- and post-operatively by urologists.

BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data about functional outcomes of Robot-assisted 
Radical Cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder (ICON), and 
the impact of learning curve (LC) on those outcomes remains to be addressed. The 
aim of this study was to report long-term functional outcomes of our single 
center series of RARC with ICON, assessing the role of LC in their achievement.
METHODS: Patients treated with Robot assisted radical cystectomy with 
intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder in our center between January 2012 and 
August 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative, clinical, 
perioperative, pathologic and functional data were reported. The first cases 
were divided in tertiles, for assessing the impact of learning curve on the 
outcomes evaluated. Long-term functional outcomes of the whole cohort were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 167 patients were included. Concerning tertiles analysis, 
operative time (P<0.001), incidence of low (P=0.002) and high grade (P=0.001) 
complications and hospital stay (P=0.04) decreased significantly over time. 
Day-time continence recovery probability was significantly lower in the initial 
case series (1-yr rate 68.4%, 87% and 89.8 for I, II and III tertile, 
respectively; P=0.04;). Accordingly, Trifecta achievement was significantly 
higher in II and III tertiles (P=0.01). At a median follow- up of 34 months, the 
incidence of significant renal function deterioration of the whole cohort was 
16.7%. Overall, 12, 24 and 60-mo day-time continence rates were 74.8%, 82.7% and 
82.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated at the beginning of the learning curve show worse 
perioperative and functional results. Once standardized the procedure, 
complications rates, hospital stay, and day-time continence recovery experienced 
a significant improvement. At a long-term analysis of functional outcomes of our 
patients, renal function preservation and continence recovery results are 
encouraging.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the complications and oncologic outcomes of orthotopic 
ileal neobladder reconstruction (ONB) following pelvic radiotherapy (RT) 
compared to patients with no prior pelvic RT.
METHODS: Our institutional database was queried for all patients with 
pT0-4bN0-3M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who underwent radical 
cystectomy with curative intent and ONB between 1990 and 2018. We then queried 
this cohort for patients who had prior pelvic RT (>3900 cGy) and compared 
baseline characteristics, perioperative complications, and recurrence free 
survival between patients with and without prior pelvic RT.
RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and forty-six patients matched our inclusion 
criteria; 34 had prior pelvic RT with a median dose of 6280 cGy. Prior RT 
targeted the bladder, prostate, and cervix in 27, 6, and 1 patient, 
respectively. Median time from RT to cystectomy was 15.5 months. Patients with 
prior RT had a longer time from diagnosis to cystectomy, more frequently had ≥5 
TURBT and neoadjuvant chemo, and less frequently had multifocal disease. 
Perioperative complications including operative time, estimated blood loss, days 
hospitalized, as well as 30- and 90-day complication rates, were not 
statistically different. There was no statistical difference in recurrence free 
survival between the 2 groups (P = .48).
CONCLUSION: ONB in highly selected patients with prior pelvic RT is feasible 
with statistically similar perioperative complication rates compared to ONB 
without prior RT.

Introduction: To compare surgical, oncologic, functional outcomes and 
complication rate between intracorporeal neobladder (ICNB) and extracorporeal 
neobladder (ECNB) orthotopic ileal neobladder of robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) in patients with nonmetastatic bladder carcinoma (BC). 
Materials and Methods: From 2014 to 2019, we prospectively collected and 
retrospectively analyzed 101 patients with nonmetastatic BC treated with RARC 
and ortothopic neobladder. Chi-squared test estimated differences in proportions 
of functional and oncologic outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression models 
(MLRMs) focused on overall, early (<30 days from discharge), and late 
complication rate (>30 days from discharge) in ICNB vs ECNB. Results: Of all 
patients, 57 (56.4%) ICNB and 44 (43.6%) ECNB patients were identified. At least 
one complication occurred in 75.4% vs 72.7% in ICNB vs ECNB, respectively 
(p = 0.9). In MLRMs, focusing on complication rate, there was no statistically 
significant difference between ICNB vs ECNB for overall (p = 0.8), early 
(p = 0.6), and late complications (p = 0.8). No statistically significant 
differences were recorded for tumor relapse rate, cancer-specific and other 
cause mortality. No positive surgical margins were recorded in both groups. 
Daytime and nighttime continence recovery were 89.4% vs 87.1% (p = 1.0) and 
63.8% vs 51.6% (p = 1.0) for ICNB vs ECNB. Potency recovery was 59.1% vs 54.3% 
(p = 0.5) for ICNB vs ECNB. Conclusions: No statistically significant 
differences in complication rate (overall, early, or late) were identified, when 
ICNB and ECNB were compared. Similarly, no statistically significant difference 
was found in oncologic and functional outcomes.

Objective To develop an ideal surgical procedure for neobladder reconstruction 
in experimental porcine models. Methods Six experimental female pigs weighting 
28-33 kg underwent transplantation of autologous peritoneum for bladder 
reconstruction under general anesthesia.The flaps were used to reconstruct the 
orthotopic neobladder by suturing with the edges of the triangle and neck of the 
remnant bladder.The ureteral catheters were removed on the 5 th postoperative 
day and the balloon catheter was removed on the 7 th postoperative day.Voiding 
behaviour was monitored.The animals were euthanized at week 12 for routine 
pathology,immunohistochemistry,and electron microscopy. Results All the pigs 
survived after the surgery,and no postoperative complication such as 
peritonitis,intestinal obstruction,or urinary fistula was observed.All the 
peritoneum-ileum composite free valves survived after transplantation.Voiding 
behaviour was normal after catheter removal,and the urine was clear.At 
autopsy,reconstructed bladders were healthy.Pathological examination showed the 
neobladder had been covered by continuous urothelium while the peritoneum 
disappeared and showed no ileal mucosa regrowth and residual.Scanning electron 
microscope showed the transitional cells of neobladder were complete and 
orderly,and the urothelium around suture border was continuous and showed no 
malposition. Conclusions Reconstruction of bladder by autologous peritoneum and 
ileal seromuscular flaps is an ideal approach in the experimental pigs as it can 
prevent regrowth of ileal epithelial cells and avoid the complications of 
conventional enterocystoplasty.Its clinical application deserves further 
investigations.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the long-term chronological changes in 
urination status of patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) followed by 
orthotopic ileal neobladder (ONB) reconstruction using the International 
Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) and the Overactive Bladder Symptoms Score 
(OABSS).
METHODS: This retrospective study focused on patients who underwent RC followed 
by ONB reconstruction and those who consented for IPSS, quality of life (QOL) 
based on urinary symptoms (IPSS-QOL), and OABSS assessments in the follow-up 
period. The patients were divided according to gender into the male group 
(M-group) and female group (F-group). All patients were evaluated using IPSS, 
IPSS-QOL, and OABSS every 3 months. The primary endpoint was to assess 
chronological changes in the urination status of patients who underwent ONB 
reconstruction after RC.
RESULTS: The median age of the enrolled patients (n = 122) was 65 years and the 
median follow-up period was 92.0 months. The median voiding symptom score in 
IPSS after 10 years of surgery was significantly higher in the M-group than in 
the F-group. Contrarily, the F-group demonstrated a significantly higher median 
storage symptom score at 60-66 and 102-114 months than the M-group. The median 
OABSS scores were relatively higher in the F-group than in the M-group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although long-term urinary function with ONB demonstrated 
acceptable results, dysfunctional voiding was observed > 10 years after surgery. 
Thus, the changes in long-term urinary function should be considered when 
deciding ONB.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BCa) is the most common urinary malignancy. The 
standard surgical treatment for patients with muscle-invasive BCa is cystectomy 
plus urinary diversion. Ileal conduit (IC) or orthotopic neobladder (ON), which 
have different indications, are the most commonly performed urinary diversions.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We sampled 5480 BCa patients from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2004 to 2015. Kaplan-Meier 
method with the log-rank test was used to assess cancer-specific survival (CSS) 
and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox's proportional hazard 
model was conducted to evaluate the hazard ratio of cancer-specific mortality 
and all-cause mortality before and after propensity score matching (PSM).
RESULTS: We identified 5480 patients who received radical cystectomy (RC) plus 
IC (n = 5071) or ON (n = 409) with a median follow-up period of 33 months 
(interquartile range, 13-78 months). Patients in the ON group tended to be male 
and younger, with a higher percentage of married individuals, early pathological 
T stage, lymphadenectomy, and non-radiotherapy (all P < .05). After 1:1 PSM, 409 
matched pairs were selected. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that 
the ON group had better CSS and OS probabilities than the IC group in the 
overall cohort [hazard ratio (HR): 0.692, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 
0.576-0.831, P < .001; HR: 0.677, 95% CI: 0.579-0.793, P < .001 respectively]. 
However, subgroup analysis revealed that only patients with pathological T2 
stage benefited from ON diversion after PSM in the context of CSS (P = .016) and 
OS (P <.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Young, married, and male patients with early pathological T stage, 
especially T2 stage, were more suitable to receive RC plus ON surgery, which 
could improve their probability of survival.

PURPOSE: There is a lack of data on true long-term functional outcome of 
orthotopic bladder substitution. The primary study objective was to report our 
35-year clinical experience.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since October 1985, 259 male patients from a large single 
center radical cystectomy series with complete followup of more than 60 months 
(median 121, range 60-267) without recurrence, irradiation or undiversion that 
might have affected the functional outcome, were included.
RESULTS: Median age at radical cystectomy and at survey was 63 (range 23-81) and 
75 (range 43-92) years, respectively. Overall 87% of patients voided 
spontaneously and residual-free. This rate decreased with increasing age at the 
time of surgery (less than 50 years old 94%, 70 years old or older 82%). Overall 
day/nighttime continence rates were 90%/82%. These rates decreased with 
increasing age at the time of surgery from 100%/88% to 87%/80%. The overall 
pad-free rate was 71%/47%. Bicarbonate use decreased from 51% (5 years) to 19% 
(25 years). Patients with a followup of more than 20 years had the lowest rate 
of residual urine and clean intermittent catheterization (0.0%) as well as use 
of more than 1 pad at daytime/nighttime (6.3%/12.5%) and mucus obstruction 
(0.0%). Serum creatinine showed only the age related increase. The surgical 
complication rate was 27% and correlated inversely with functional results 
(chi-squared 11.227, p <0.005), even when the younger age at the time of surgery 
(younger than 60 years) was related to higher rates of surgical complications 
(chi-squared 6.80, p <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The ileal neobladder represents an excellent long-term option for 
urinary diversion with an acceptable complication rate.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors affecting urethral recurrence (UR) in men 
after radical cystectomy (RC) with ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 348 men who underwent RC with 
IONB for bladder cancer between January 2010 and December 2017. 
Clinicopathologic characteristics, including tumor location (trigone and/or 
bladder neck), prostatic urethral and/or stromal involvement, presence of 
carcinoma in situ (CIS), pathologic T and N stage, and urethral resection margin 
status, were identified. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to illustrate 
urethral recurrence-free survival (URFS), and Cox proportional hazard models 
were applied to identify factors predicting UR.
RESULTS: Of the 348 patients, UR was identified in 7 (2.0%) patients during the 
mean follow-up of 33.3 months. The 2-, 3-, and 5-year URFS rates were 97.6%, 
96.3%, and 93.8%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, prostatic urethral 
involvement (P = 0.033, hazard ratio: 6.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-36.96) 
was an independent predictor of UR. When patients were divided according to 
prostatic urethral involvement (negative vs positive), the 2- and 3-year URFS 
rates were significantly different (93.8% and 96.8%, respectively, vs 92.0% and 
92.0%, respectively; P = 0.020). All 7 patients with UR underwent transurethral 
surgery and maintained their IONB.
CONCLUSION: In this series, UR occurred in approximately 2% of men after RC with 
IONB. Prostatic urethral involvement was the only significant prognostic factor 
for UR. Follow-up strategies considering UR risk should be adopted to facilitate 
early detection in those at high risk of UR.

INTRODUCTION: We validated a Japanese version of the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) 
as a tool for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in bladder cancer 
patients treated with various surgical procedures.
METHODS: The reliability and validity of the Japanese BCI were examined in 397 
Japanese patients with bladder cancer via cross-sectional analysis. The patients 
simultaneously completed the Short Form (SF)-12, EQ-5D, and the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Bladder (FACT-G and FACT-BL). The 
differences in BCI subscales among various treatment groups were analyzed.
RESULTS: This study involved 397 patients (301 males and 96 females), with a 
mean age of 70 years and a median disease duration of 29 months (IQR: 
12-66 months). Of these patients, 221 underwent transurethral resection of a 
bladder tumor, and 176 patients underwent radical cystectomy (ileal conduit: 101 
patients, ileal neobladder: 49, and ureterostomy: 26). Cronbach's alpha 
coefficient was ≥ 0.78 for all subscales, except the bowel bother subscale. 
Despite moderate correlations being detected between the function and bother 
score in urinary and bowel domains, the sexual function score was inversely 
correlated with the sexual bother score (r = - 0.19). A missing value percentage 
of > 15% was associated with old age (p < 0.05). The mean domain scores differed 
significantly among distinct clinically relevant treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Although revisions are needed to make it easier for elderly 
patients to comprehend, we confirmed the reliability and validity of the 
Japanese BCI. The Japanese BCI could be used for cross-cultural assessments of 
HRQOL in bladder cancer patients.

Orthotopic neobladder after cystectomy for bladder cancer.

Kakizoe T(1).

Author information:
(1)Japan Cancer Society.

More than 90% of bladder cancer is composed of transitional cell carcinoma 
(TCC), being characterized by the development of multiple tumors in the entire 
urinary tract over time. When cystectomy is conducted, the urinary tract must be 
reconstructed by various procedures, which can include an orthotopic neobladder 
using the patient's own intestine formed into a spherical shape anastomosed to 
the urethra. Using this procedure, patients can void urine from their own 
urethra even after cystectomy. The incidence of subsequent urethral cancer 
arising after cystectomy is known to be relatively high; however, if patients 
with a high risk of urethral recurrence are appropriately excluded, a neobladder 
can be safely provided for patients. Orthotopic neobladder use is reviewed from 
an oncological viewpoint and the patient's quality of life after cystectomy for 
bladder cancer.

Villous Adenoma Arising in the Urethra of a Female with Bladder Augmentation 
History: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

[Article in English]

TURKEY.

Villous adenomas (VAs) in the female urethra are rare with only seven cases in 
the English literature to our knowledge. In patients with bladder augmentation 
cystoplasty, the neoplasia development risk increases and most of these develop 
in the neobladder or anastomosis line. Only two cases of VA developing from the 
native bladder mucosa have been reported. Physical examination of a 76-year-old 
female who had a history of augmentation cystoplasty revealed a caruncula-like 
structure protruding from the urethral meatus. The urinary USG showed that the 
lesion had no relation with the bladder. The lesion was excised. 
Microscopically, it consisted of villous structures covered with 
pseudostratified intestinal type epithelium. Low-grade dysplasia was present in 
the epithelium but high-grade dysplasia or in-situ/invasive carcinoma was not 
observed. Immunohistochemical study showed positivity for CK7, CK20, EMA, CEA 
and CDX2. The case was reported as VA of the urethra. We presented the first VA 
case arising in the urethra of a female patient with intestinal bladder 
augmentation. Excision is curative for pure VAs. Transformation to carcinoma or 
recurrence has not been reported. However, in one third of the cases, a 
malignant tumor may accompany the lesion. Therefore, all excision material 
should be examined carefully. Routine endoscopic follow-up should be performed 
in cases with bladder augmentation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate oncological outcomes in patients with bladder cancer 
who underwent minimally invasive radical cystectomy (MIRC) or open radical 
cystectomy (ORC).
METHODS: We identified patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical 
cystectomy (RC) in 13 centers of the Chinese Bladder Cancer Consortium (CBCC). 
Perioperative outcomes were compared between MIRC and ORC. The influence of 
surgical approaches on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) 
in the entire study group and subgroups classified according to pathologic stage 
or lymph node (LN) status was assessed with the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association among OS, CSS 
and risk factors of interest.
RESULTS: Of 2 098 patients who underwent RC, 1 243 patients underwent MIRC (1 
087 laparoscopic RC and 156 robotic-assisted RC, respectively), while 855 
patients underwent ORC. No significant differences were noted in positive 
surgical margin rate and 90-day postoperative mortality rate. MIRC was 
associated with less estimated blood loss, more LN yield, higher rate of 
neobladder diversion, longer operative time, and longer length of hospital stay. 
There was no significant difference in OS and CSS according to surgical 
approaches (p=0.653, and 0.816, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed that 
OS and CSS were not significantly different regardless of the status of 
extravesical involvement or LN involvement. Multivariable Cox regression 
analyses showed that the surgical approach was not a significant predictor of OS 
and CSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that MIRC was comparable to conventional ORC in 
terms of OS and CSS.

OBJECTIVE:  Radical cystectomy (RCX) is the standard treatment for 
muscle-invasive and treatment-refractory non-invasive bladder cancer, but that 
is associated with high morbidity. We now survey current practice patterns on 
perioperative management among German urological departments of all sizes 
METHODS:  Members of the German Association of Urology and the German Society of 
Residents in Urology (GeSRU) were contacted by email and asked to answer a 
24-item online questionnaire covering clinically relevant aspects of current 
guidelines and controversies.
RESULTS:  Responses were obtained from at least 19 % of all German urological 
centers. About 60 % performed preoperative staging using CT urography and chest 
CT. The most common perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was a third generation 
cephalosporin combined with metronidazole (46 %), administered for a median of 5 
days. Stentograms for ileal conduit and neobladder are routinely performed in 
38 % and 55 % of patients, respectively. Ureteral stents were usually removed 
11 - 12 days after the procedure (ileal conduit and neobladder). Based on the 
surrogate parameters of preoperative bowel preparation, postoperative start of 
oral nutrition and use of nasogastric tube, fast-track concepts such as ERAS 
were not generally established (< 50 %). Robot-assisted cystectomy appears to be 
performed in 15 % of German urological centers and was associated with the 
number of performed cystectomies (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS:  Most aspects of perioperative management in cystectomy patients - 
staging diagnostics, use of antibiotics, stent removal - are performed in 
accordance with current guidelines. Other clinical questions such as stent 
imaging before removal and fast track concepts are handled heterogeneously. 
Guideline-adherence was not associated with hospital size or number of 
procedures performed.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND UND ZIELSETZUNG:  Die radikale Zystektomie (RCX) ist die 
kurative Standardbehandlung für muskelinvasive Harnblasenkarzinome. Aufgrund des 
operativen Ausmaßes und der damit verbundenen komplexen stationären Betreuung 
ist die RCX mit hoher Morbidität und Mortalität verbunden. Ziel war es, Daten 
aus dem klinischen Alltag zur gegenwärtigen Praxis des perioperativen 
Managements zu erfassen.
METHODEN:  Mitglieder der DGU und der German Society of Residents in Urology 
beantworteten anonym einen 24 Fragen umfassenden Online-Fragebogen. Gegenstand 
waren sowohl klinisch relevante Aspekte der gegenwärtigen EAU/DGU-Leitlinien als 
auch kontrovers diskutierte klinische Fragen.
ERGEBNISSE:  Durch die Teilnehmer konnten mindestens 19 % aller infrage 
kommenden deutschen Zentren erfasst werden. Mehrheitlich wird das präoperative 
Staging mittels CT-Urografie und CT-Thorax durchgeführt. Die meistgenutzte 
Antibiotikaprophylaxe umfasst ein Drittgenerations-Cephalosporin plus 
Metronidazol (46 %), welche im Median für 5 Tage verabreicht werden. 
Harnleiterschienen (HS) werden im Mittel beim Ileumconduit am 11. und bei der 
Neoblase am 12. Tag nach RCX entfernt. Gemessen an Surrogatparametern wie oraler 
Darmvorbereitung, Beginn des Kostaufbaus und Einsatz einer Magensonde sind 
aktuelle Fast-Track-Konzepte noch nicht allgemein verbreitet (< 50 %).
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN:  Die meisten Aspekte des perioperativen Managements werden 
leitliniengerecht durchgeführt, so z. B. Staging-Untersuchungen, Einsatz von 
Antibiotika und Entfernung der HS. Andere klinische Fragestellungen wie 
Durchführung einer Bildgebung vor Entfernung der HS und Fast-Track-Konzepte 
werden unterschiedlich gehandhabt, obwohl zunehmende Evidenz in diesen Bereichen 
existiert. Leitlinienadhärenz war nicht mit Zentrumsgröße oder Anzahl der 
Eingriffe assoziiert.

Purpose: Benign ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture (UEAS) is a common 
postoperative complication after urinary diversion with an incidence of 3%-10%. 
Our objective is to report long-term follow-up of our technique for 
endoscopically managing UEAS after cystectomy. Materials and Methods: Patients 
with endoscopically managed benign UEAS after cystectomy were included. 
Intervention entailed anetegrade flexible ureteroscopy with biopsy followed by 
laser incision of the stricture and of periureteral and peri-ileal tissues 1 cm 
below and 1 cm above the stricture into fat. Triamcinolone injection was then 
performed, followed by balloon dilation of the incised area to 24F. Parallel 
Double-J ureteral stents or upside down nephrostomy tubes were placed for 6 
weeks. CT scans were obtained at 3 months and 1 year after surgery, and renal 
ultrasound at 6 and 9 months, and then annually. Results: Twenty-one patients, 
and a total of 24 UEAS were treated. Urinary diversion included ileal conduit 
(n = 12), neobladder (n = 7), and Indiana pouch (n = 2). Twenty out of 24 
strictures had no recurrence, including three patients who had bilateral 
disease, yielding an overall success rate of 83.3%. The remaining three patients 
with recurrence had evidence of stricture within 3 months. Follow-up ranged from 
8 to 102 months, with a median of 30 months. Conclusions: Patients treated 
endoscopically for UEAS have been shown to have acceptable immediate success 
with less morbidity when compared with ureteral reimplantation. Our technique of 
laser incision, triamcinolone injection, balloon dilation, and temporary stent 
placement has a success rate of over 80% and is unique in that long-term data 
confirms the durability of this endoscopic procedure.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the oncological significance of a robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC)-related pentafecta in patients with bladder cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the KORARC database, which includes data from 12 
centres, data from 730 patients who underwent RARC between April 2007 and May 
2019 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed. Pentafecta was 
achieved if patients met all of the following criteria: (i) negative soft tissue 
surgical margin; (ii) ≥16 lymph nodes removed; (iii) no major complications 
(Clavien-Dindo grade 3-5) within 90 days; (iv) no clinical recurrence within the 
first 12 months; and (v) no ureteroenteric stricture. Patients were divided into 
two groups according to pentafecta attainment, and a comparison of overall 
survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) using multivariate Cox 
proportional analysis was then carried out.
RESULTS: Of the 730 patients included in this analysis, 208 (28.5%) attained the 
RARC pentafecta; the remaining 522 (71.5%) did not. The mean age of the patients 
was 64.67 years, 85.1% were men, 53.6% received a conduit, 37.7% received 
orthotopic neobladders and the total complication rate was 57.8%. Those who 
attained the pentafecta received more neobladders (P = 0.039), were more likely 
to be treated with the intracorporeal technique (P < 0.001), had longer 
operating times (P = 0.020) and had longer console time (P = 0.021) compared 
with those who did not attain the pentafecta. Over a mean of 31.1 months of 
follow-up, the pentafecta attainment group had significantly higher OS and CSS 
rates compared with the non-attainment group (10-year OS 70.4% vs 58.1%, 
respectively [P = 0.016]; 10-year CSS 87.8% vs 70.0%, respectively [P = 0.036]). 
Multivariate analysis showed that the RARC pentafecta was a significant 
predictor of overall mortality (hazard ratio 0.561; P = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who attained the RARC pentafecta had significantly better 
survival outcomes compared with those who did not. These criteria could be used 
to standardize assessment of the surgical quality of RARC. In the future, a 
similar study using an independent cohort is warranted to confirm our results.

Objective: To describe urinary tract infections (UTIs) after robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) and investigate the variables associated with it. 
Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 616 patients who underwent RARC 
between 2005 and 2019 was performed. Patients were divided into those who 
developed UTI and those who did not. Patients who developed UTI were further 
subdivided into three subgroups according to the onset, number, and severity. 
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to depict time to UTI. Multivariate analysis 
was used to investigate variables associated with UTI. Result: Two hundred forty 
(39%) patients were diagnosed with UTI after RARC; 48% occurred within 30 days, 
17% within 30-90 days, and 35% at 90 days after RARC. Twenty-three percent of 
the patients presented with urosepsis. The median (interquartile ratio) time to 
develop UTI was 1 (0.3-7) month. On multivariate analysis, patients who received 
neobladders (odds ratio [OR] 2.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-5.20; 
p < 0.01), prolonged hospital stay (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.08; p < 0.01), 
adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.40-3.60; p < 0.01), poor renal function 
postoperatively (OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.30-3.80; p < 0.01), postoperative 
hydronephrosis (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.40-4.50; p < 0.01), ureteroileal anastomotic 
stricture (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.50-5.70; p < 0.01), and stented ureteroileal 
anastomosis (OR 9.35; 95% CI 1.23-71.19; p = 0.03) were associated with UTI 
after RARC. Conclusion: UTI is common after RARC mainly within the first month 
after RARC. Enterococcus faecalis was the most common causative organism.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of urinary diversion on regular features of 
urinalysis and to screen for risk factors of infection-related complications.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-centre study of 429 patients who 
underwent open radical cystectomy. Patients were followed for 12 months and data 
of the complete urinalyses were analysed at three pre-defined time points.
RESULTS: Two weeks after surgery, dipstick testing with positive reactions for 
leukocyte esterase and haemoglobin were confirmed in 80.7% and 80% after ileal 
conduit (IC) and orthotopic ileal neobladder (NB), respectively. Every patient 
was positive for these parameters 12 months after surgery. Correspondingly, the 
microscopic examination detected leukocytes (84% vs. 85.4%), erythrocytes (82.8% 
vs. 83.8%) and bacteria (94.3% vs. 96.8%) following IC and NB reconstruction. 
After 12 months, all parameters were positive irrespective of the type of 
urinary diversion. Two weeks after surgery positive urine cultures were obtained 
in more than 50% of cases after IC (52.5%) and NB (60.5%) (p > 0.05). All urine 
cultures were positive after 12 months with significantly more poly-microbial 
results found after NB (81.3%) compared with IC (67.2%) (p = 0.018). In 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis the presence of 
hydronephrosis was independently associated with the occurrence of infectious 
complications (OR 4.2; CI 95% 1.525-11.569; p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: A positive urinalysis is a common finding after urinary diversion. 
Hydronephrosis is a serious risk factor with respect to infection-related 
complications. The simple fact of a positive urinalysis does not warrant 
antimicrobial treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Neobladder vaginal fistula (NVF) is a known complication after 
cystectomy and orthotopic diversion in women, occurring in 3-5% of women. 
Possible risk factors for fistula formation include compromised tissue 
vascularity due to surgical dissection and/or radiotherapy, suture line 
proximity, local tissue recurrence, and injury to the vaginal wall during 
dissection. The surgical repair of a NVF can be challenging secondary to vaginal 
shortening, atrophy, local inflammation from chronic exposure to urinary 
leakage, and the proximity of the neobladder to the anterior vaginal wall. In 
this video, we present transvaginal repair of a NVF with Martius flap 
interposition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is the case of a 47 year old woman with a history of 
radical cystectomy and creation of a Studer pouch secondary to bladder cancer 
two years prior who subsequently developed a NVF. Evaluation included an office 
cystoscopy which demonstrated a 3-4mm left-sided neobladder vaginal fistula at 
the level of the ileal-urethral anastomosis. No pelvic organ prolapse or 
evidence of bladder cancer recurrence was appreciated.
RESULTS: A vaginal approach for the NVF repair was performed with a Martius flap 
interposition. A water-tight closure was achieved without any intraoperative or 
immediate postoperative complications. The urethral Foley was removed at 2 weeks 
and by 4 weeks the patient did not report any urinary leakage.
CONCLUSIONS: Neobladder vaginal fistula is a rare complication following 
cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion that can be repaired using a 
transvaginal approach. A Martius flap interposition is important to augment 
success of the repair. If a transvaginal approach fails a transabdominal 
approach or conversion to cutaneous diversion may be necessary.

BACKGROUND: Little data on the preoperative prognostic factors in radical 
cystectomy (RC) patients have made it difficult to choose the appropriate type 
of urothelial diversion (UD). This study aimed to investigate the prognostic 
role of UD, with a subgroup analysis of that of preoperative renal function.
METHODS: From 1990 to 2015, 279 patients underwent RC for bladder cancer at six 
hospitals affiliated with Kitasato University in Japan. All patients were 
divided into three groups: cutaneous ureterostomy (CU; n = 54), ileal conduit 
(IC; n = 139), and orthotopic neobladder (NB; n = 86). Patients were also 
stratified into three groups based on preoperative estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) (mL/min/1.73 m2): normal eGFR (> 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; 
n = 149), moderately reduced eGFR (45-60 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 66), and severely 
reduced eGFR (< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 37). Statistical analyses were performed 
to investigate prognostic values of UD and preoperative eGFR.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that progression-free survival (PFS) and 
cancer-specific survival (CSS) did not differ between the three types of UD 
groups. With regard to renal function, the preoperative severely reduced group 
had significantly worse PFS and CSS than the other groups. The multivariate 
analysis showed that severely reduced preoperative eGFR was an independent risk 
factor of worse PFS and worse CSS.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that preoperative severe renal 
function was shown as an independent risk factor of both PFS and CSS.

A posterior reconstruction (PR) might improve the fluidity and delicacy of the 
maneuvers related to the neovesico-urethral anastomosis during robotic-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC). Our objective is to describe in detail the surgical 
steps of PR and to assess its feasibility and functional outcomes. The data 
regarding patients undergoing a totally intracorporeal RARC with neobladder and 
PR for high-grade and/or muscle-invasive urothelial cancer of the bladder at 
Karolinska University Hospital between October 2015 and November 2016 by a 
single surgeon (PW) were reviewed. Prior to the anastomosis, a modified 
posterior Rocco's repair involving the Denonvillier's fascia, the 
rhabdosphincter, and the posterior side of the ileal neobladder neck was 
performed. The steps are shown in a video at 
https://doi.org/10.1089/vid.2019.0029 . The primary outcome was urinary 
continence; the secondary outcomes were urinary leakage, intermittent 
catheterization, and complications related to the reconstructive steps. Eleven 
male patients with a median age and BMI of 67 years and 24, respectively, 
underwent RARC with PR associated to the neovesico-urethral anastomosis. Overall 
and posterior reconstruction time were 300' (195-320) and 6' (4-7), 
respectively. The daytime and nighttime continence rates were 100% and 44% at 
12 months, respectively; the median pad weight was 3.5 g and 108 g at daytime 
and nighttime, respectively. One urinary leakage from the urethrovesical 
anastomosis was treated conservatively. Two patients perform intermittent 
catheterization. The posterior reconstruction during RARC is safe and feasible, 
providing good continence rates. It supported a careful suturing of the 
anastomosis as well as an uncomplicated catheter placement.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: In this study, we reported the 2 years outcomes of 
orthotopic neobladder diversion according to the Studer modified technique 
described by Bianchi G. et al. This technique improves the stability of the 
reservoir and the urine-storage capacity. After radical cystectomy, urinary 
diversion is created with a spheroidal-shaped reservoir with a conic 
distal-part, obtained with 40 cm detubulized ileal segment, and a 15 cm of 
tubular afferent limb, where a Wallace ureteral anastomoses is made. The conic 
distal part of the neobladder that is anastomized to the urethral stump. After 
the reconstructive part, the neobladder and the afferent limb are attached to 
the elevator ani and psoas muscles, respectively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 18 patients underwent radical cystectomy with the 
reconstruction of urinary diversion with the Modified-Studer Orthotopic 
technique, at S. Giuseppe Hospital. We studied the post-operative years of 
follow-up, especially with anamnesis of lower urinary tract, axial computerized 
tomography, and blood tests, according to the EAU guidelines.
RESULTS: We discover with TC 2 cases of low-grade bilateral hydronephrosis, 
associated with a slight increase in creatinine levels (1.4-1.8 mg/dL). No 
stricture at the neobladder-urethral anastomosis was detected. Three patients 
complain daytime urinary incontinence; only two patients report nocturnal 
urinary incontinence. One patient underwent ureteroscopy for lithiasis and 1 
patient died for non-onco-urological disease.
CONCLUSION: The modifications we applied to the Studer-Neobladder seems to 
improve urinary tract restoration, potentially decreasing long-term 
complications like hydronephrosis connected to ureteral anastomotic stenosis 
(11.1% vs 16.9% reported in literature) and urinary retention (0% vs 12% 
reported in literature). However, we discovered the same risk of diurnal and 
nocturnal incontinence reported in literature for the classic Studer Neobladder.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in 
patients who underwent ileal conduit (IC) vs orthotopic neobladder (ONB) as a 
method of urinary diversion (UD) after radical cystectomy (RC) for invasive 
bladder cancers.
METHODS: The questionnaires of the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Bladder Cancer (FACT-BL) were used to evaluate and compare the HrQoL in 
113 patients with 1 year follow-up.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the ONB group and 64 patients in 
the IC group. Patients with IC showed superior scores in all domains of the 
FACT-BL questionnaire and this reached statistical significance in physical 
well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), over all FACT-G, Bladder-Specific 
Subscale and FACT-BL total scores (P-values = .01, .01, .001, .001, and .001, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate marginally improved HrQoL in IC patients 
when compared with patients undergoing ONB which may be attributed to an 
increased morbidity and postoperative complications in the ONB group.

A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and 
underwent transurethral resection of the lesions in August 2017. The 
pathological findings revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The tumor 
relapsed as urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid/osteosarcoma variant with 
vascular invasion, and transurethral resection was performed in December 2017. 
He underwent laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy and orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction using ileum in March 2018. The patient developed lung metastasis 
in July 2018. He underwent four courses of chemotherapy with doxorubicin and 
thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy of the lung in October 2018.

PURPOSE: This umbrella review aims to evaluate the quality, summarize and 
compare the conclusions of systematic reviews investigating the impact of 
curative treatment options on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched 
independently by two authors from inception until 06 January 2020. Systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses assessing the impact of any curative treatment option 
on HRQol in MIBC patients were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using the 
AMSTAR 2 tool.
RESULTS: Thirty-two reviews were included. Robot-assisted RC with extracorporeal 
urinary diversion and open RC have similar HRQoL (n = 10). Evidence for pelvic 
organ-sparing RC was too limited (n = 2). Patients with a neobladder showed 
better overall and physical HRQoL outcomes, but worse urinary function in 
comparison with ileal conduit (n = 17). Bladder-preserving radiochemotherapy 
showed slightly better urinary and sexual but worse gastro-intestinal HRQoL 
outcomes in comparison with RC patients (n = 6). Quality of the reviews was low 
in more than 50% of the available reviews and most of the studies included in 
the reviews were nonrandomized studies.
CONCLUSION: This umbrella review gives a comprehensive overview of the available 
evidence to date.

OBJECTIVES: Cystectomy with urinary diversion is associated with decreased 
long-term kidney function due to several factors. One factor that has been 
debated is the type of urinary diversion used: ileal conduit (IC) vs. neobladder 
(NB). We tested the hypothesis that long-term kidney function will not vary by 
type of urinary diversion.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent 
cystectomy with urinary diversion at our institution from January 1, 2007, to 
January 1, 2018. Data were collected on patient demographics, comorbid 
conditions, perioperative radiotherapy, and complications. Creatinine values 
were measured at several time points up to 120 months after surgery. Glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) (ml/min per 1.73 m2) was calculated using the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. A linear mixed model with 
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to compare GFR 
between the IC and NB cohorts over time. Multiple sensitivity analyses were 
performed based on 2 different calculations of GFR (Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration equation vs. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease), 
with and without excluding patients with preoperative GFR less than 40 ml/min 
per 1.73 m2.
RESULTS: Among 563 patients who underwent cystectomy with urinary diversion, a 
NB was used for 72 (12.8%) individuals. Patients who had a NB were significantly 
younger, had a lower American Society of Anesthesiologists score, greater 
baseline GFR, better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 
lower median Charlson comorbidity index, and were less likely to have received 
preoperative abdominal radiation (all P < 0.05). Both NB and IC patients had 
decreased kidney function over time, with mean GFR losses at 5 years of 17% and 
14% of baseline values, respectively. The IPTW-adjusted linear mixed model 
revealed that IC patients had slightly more deterioration in kidney function 
over time, but this was not statistically significant (estimate, 0.12; 
P = 0.06). The sensitivity analyses yielded a similar trend, in that GFR 
decrease appeared to be greater in the IC cohort. This trend was statistically 
significant when using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Among highly selected patients with an NB, deterioration of kidney 
function may potentially be lower over time than among IC patients. However, the 
statistical significance varied between analyses and we cautiously attribute 
these observed differences to patient selection.

PURPOSE: Radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion in the treatment of 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer is associated with peri-operative complication 
rates as high as 60%. Ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture (UEAS) is a potential 
source significant morbidity often requiring secondary interventions. We sought 
to evaluate our experience with benign UEAS in our open ileal orthotopic 
neobladder (ON) population.
METHODS: After Internal Review Board (IRB) approval, we performed a 
retrospective review of patients who had RC and ON between 2000 and 2015 at MD 
Anderson Cancer Center and had at least 6 months of follow-up. Baseline 
demographics and treatment characteristics, peri-operative and post-operative 
outcomes, as well as information regarding anastomosis technique and suture 
types were evaluated. Patients with malignant ureteral obstruction were excluded 
from the analysis.
RESULTS: 418 patients had ON creation and the mean age was 59 years (SD 
9.4 years) and 90% were males. The mean follow-up was 57 months (6-183 months). 
37 patients (8.9%) developed UEAS in 42 renal units and the mean time to 
diagnosis was 15.8 months (0.85-90 months). Anastomosis and suture type were not 
predictive of UEAS (p = 0.594, p = 0.586). Perioperative UTI within 30 days of 
surgery, and recurrent UTI were predictive of UEAS, HR 2.4 p = 0.03, HR 5.1 
p < 0.001, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: UEAS are associated with potentially significant morbidity 
following ON creation. UEAS may occur early following ON, but may occur as late 
as 7 years following surgery. Indeed, technical factors and surgeon experience 
contribute to the rates of UEAS, but perioperative UTI appears to herald future 
stricture development.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of frailty on the type of urinary 
diversion after radical cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer.
METHODS: Between January 2014 and January 2020, we prospectively evaluated 
frailty in 88 patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer, who had 
received radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The selection of the type of 
urinary diversion was determined by the operating surgeon based on performance 
status, comorbidities, tumor status and the patient's preference. The frailty 
evaluation included the Fried phenotype criteria, the modified frailty index and 
the frailty discriminant score. We investigated the association between frailty 
and type of urinary diversion, the effect of frailty on postoperative 
complications and the effect of frailty on overall survival.
RESULTS: The median age of the selected participants was 68 years. The number of 
patients with an orthotopic neobladder and any postoperative complications was 
54 (61%) and 46 (52%), respectively. Of the frailty assessment tools that were 
used, Fried phenotype criteria and frailty discriminant score were significantly 
associated with the selection of non-orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion. 
Occurrences of postoperative complications in participants were significantly 
associated with modified frailty index, but not with Fried phenotype criteria 
and frailty discriminant score. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that 
a higher frailty discriminant score was significantly associated with poor 
overall survival, whereas higher Fried phenotype criteria and modified frailty 
index were not.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with the type of urinary 
diversion, and it should be considered for the selection of urinary diversion in 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy.

Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.

Robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) has gained popularity within 
minimally-invasive urologic surgery, and has been shown to be a safe procedure 
with similar oncologic outcomes when compared to the conventional open standard. 
While initial RARC feasibility and outcomes studies were performed with 
extracorporeal urinary diversion, intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) is 
becoming increasingly utilized. Reported benefits of an intracorporeal approach 
include decreased blood loss and a lower incidence of ureteral strictures. While 
ICUD is technically challenging, many have overcome the learning curve 
associated with this procedure via a mentorship model and a dedicated operative 
team. Techniques vary between institutions, and ileal conduit, continent 
cutaneous and orthotopic continent (neobladder) diversions have all been 
performed. Herein, we describe the learning curve, technical points, and unique 
complications associated with ICUD.

BACKGROUND: To explore the value of orthotopic spiral ileal bladder substitution 
(OSIBS) following radical cystectomy in treating bladder cancer patients by 
investigating the short- and long-term postoperative complications and assessing 
the quality of life in patients who had undergone OSIBS.
METHODS: The post-operative complications were retrospectively analyzed among 
bladder cancer patients who had undergone radical cystectomy + OSIBS in our 
center from January 2001 to January 2017. The quality of life was assessed by 
using the Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder Cancer Form (FACT-BL). 
Patients were followed up by mails, telephone, and outpatient visits.
RESULTS: A total of 68 subjects were included in this study. All patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy + OSIBS were followed up for an extended period. 
The patients aged 39-68 years (mean: 60.34±9.43 years). The surgeries were 
completed, and all the patients were smoothly discharged after good 
postoperative recovery. Of the 68 patients who had completed the follow-up 
visits, 10 had early complications (14.71%), and 11 (17.64%) developed late 
complications. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (t=0.358, P=0.764) and serum 
creatinine (Cr) (t=1.305, P=0.196) levels showed no significant difference 
before and after surgery. The serum potassium (t=1.347, P=0.169), sodium 
(t=-1.748, P=0.144), and calcium (t=1.097, P=0.319) levels also showed no 
significant changes before and after surgery. However, the change in serum 
chlorine level was statistically significant (t=-4.701, P=0.000). To support 
urinary function, the patients were encouraged to take exercises During the 
10-year follow-up period, the daytime urinary continence rate reached 94.1% 
(n=64) in the daytime, and the nighttime incontinence rate was 13.2% (n=9). Six 
months after the surgery, the neobladder capacity was (365.02±45.11) mL, the 
maximum flow rate was (14.36±1.41) mL/s, and the post-voiding residual (PVR) was 
(26.01±8.10) mL. The total FACT-BL score was (124.8±13.4) during the 10-year 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: After 10 years of follow-up, the early and late complications in 
patients who had undergone radical cystectomy + OSIBS were within acceptable 
range and the daily and nightly continence levels allowed normal daily life. 
OSIBS not only preserves the physical integrity of the body but also has normal 
physiological characteristics of the bladder. It remarkably improves the 
postoperative quality of life and can be easily accepted by patients. Therefore, 
it is an ideal surgical procedure.

OBJECTIVE: To report a single-institution experience with totally intracorporeal 
neobladder urinary diversion (UD) after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy (RARC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 158 patients underwent totally intracorporeal 
neobladder UD after RARC between 2003 and 2016. Patient demographics, 
intraoperative and pathological data, 30- and 90-day perioperative mortality and 
complications were recorded. Complications were classified according to the 
modified Clavien-Dindo classification. The 5-year overall (OS) and 
cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots.
RESULTS: Most of the patients were male (84%) and had clinical T Stage ≤2 (87%). 
The mean operation time was 359 (SD ±98) min, with a median (range) estimated 
blood loss of 300 (50-2200) mL. Most of the men (86%) received a nerve-sparing 
procedure and 38% of the females an organ-sparing approach. A lymph node 
dissection was performed in 156 (99%) patients, with a median (range) yield of 
23 (7-48) nodes. Conversion to open surgery occurred in five patients (3%). We 
recorded negative margins in 156 patients (99%). The median (range) follow-up 
was 34 (1-170) months, with 30- and 90-day mortality rates of 0%. Clavien-Dindo 
Grade III-IV complications occurred in 29 of 158 (18%) patients at 30-days and 
in eight of 158 (5%) between 30-90 days, resulting into a 90-day overall 
high-grade complication rate of 23%. The unadjusted estimated 5-years 
recurrence-free survival, CSS and OS rates were 70%, 72%, and 71%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In our present series the complication and oncological results were 
similar to open RC series, suggesting that RARC followed by totally 
intracorporeal neobladder UD is a safe and feasible alternative.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess health-related quality-of-life 
(HRQoL) in men and women operated on with radical cystectomy, compared to the 
general Norwegian population.Materials and methods: All patients with bladder 
cancer who had undergone radical cystectomy (RC) between 2011-2017 and either 
received ileal conduit (IC) or orthotopic neobladder (ONB) as urinary diversion 
were included in a cross-sectional study. HRQoL and sociodemographic data was 
collected and measured with a questionnaire consisting of the generic EORTC 
QLQ-C30.v3 and the cancer specific EORTC QLQ-BLM30 and compared to a general 
population sample.Results: Of the 220 invited patients, 173 patients (78.6%) 
returned the questionnaires. The global quality-of-life (QoL) score was 
comparable with the general population. Women had significantly higher fatigue 
score, worse future perspective and symptoms like bloating, compared to male 
patients. Men had significantly lower social functioning, more constipation, 
diarrhoea and sleep disturbance compared to the general male population. There 
was no significant difference in HRQoL domains between female patients and the 
general female population. A follow-up (FU) period longer than 37 months since 
surgery was associated with significantly improved physical- and 
role-functioning, less fatigue and fewer problems with the urostoma, compared to 
a shorter FU time.Conclusion: This study found a high global QoL score after 
radical cystectomy, comparable with the general Norwegian population. Symptoms 
seem to improve over time. Difference in HRQoL outcomes between men and woman in 
the study population was comparable with the difference found in the general 
population.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the perioperative outcomes of intracorporeal (ICUD) vs 
extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy 
(RARC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the prospectively maintained 
International Robotic Cystectomy Consortium (IRCC) database. A total of 972 
patients from 28 institutions who underwent RARC were included. Propensity score 
matching was used to match patients based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), 
American Society of Anesthesiologists Score (ASA) score, Charlson Comorbidity 
Index (CCI) score, prior radiation and abdominal surgery, receipt of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, and clinical staging. Matched cohorts were compared. Multivariate 
stepwise logistic and linear regression models were fit to evaluate variables 
associated with receiving ICUD, operating time, 90-day high-grade complications 
(Clavien-Dindo Classification Grade ≥III), and 90-day readmissions after RARC.
RESULTS: Utilisation of ICUD increased from 0% in 2005 to 95% in 2018. The ICUD 
patients had more overall complications (66% vs 58%, P = 0.01) and readmissions 
(27% vs 17%, P = 0.01), but not high-grade complications (21% vs 24%, P = 0.22). 
A more recent RC era and ileal conduit diversion were associated with receiving 
an ICUD. Higher BMI, ASA score ≥3, and receiving a neobladder were associated 
with longer operating times. Shorter operating time was associated with male 
gender, older age, ICUD, and centres with a larger annual average RC volume. 
Longer intensive care unit stay was associated with 90-day high-grade 
complications. Higher CCI score, prior radiation therapy, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, and ICUD were associated with a higher risk of 90-day 
readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilisation of ICUD has increased over the past decade. ICUD was 
associated with more overall complications and readmissions compared to ECUD, 
but not high-grade complications.

Decellularized natural bladder matrices (neobladders) represent an exciting 
means to regenerate the bladder following bladder cancer-associated cystectomy. 
In this study, we compare the evolution of decellularized matrices with 
recellularized matrices by seeding it with human adipose-derived mesenchymal 
stem cells (ADSC) after implantation following partial cystectomy in rats. We 
discovered significant anatomical differences since 10 days after neobladder 
implantation with the ADSC-containing matrices promoting a significant recovery 
of mature p63- and cytokeratin 7-positive urothelium. We also discovered 
significantly induced expression of the vimentin mesoderm marker in the 
submucosal layer in ADSC-seeded matrices. Interestingly, we found a higher 
expression of smooth muscle actin in transversal and longitudinal smooth muscle 
layers with ADSC-seeded matrices. Furthermore, ADSC also showed increased 
vascularization and nerve innervation of the neobladder as determined by the 
distribution of CD31 and S100β reactivity, respectively. We believe that ADSC 
and their paracrine-acting pro-regenerative secretome within decellularized 
matrices represent an efficient bladder substitution strategy; however, we 
require a fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved before clinical 
studies can begin.

PURPOSE: We report our experience with 23 cases in utilizing ileum to perform 
totally intracorporeal 3D laparoscopic neobladder reconstruction using two 
different surgical techniques.
METHODS: Patients candidates for reconstructive surgery were in a good 
biological status with a body mass index (BMI) in the range of 18.5-25 and 
presented a muscle-infiltrative bladder tumor with negative nodal frozen 
sections performed during the operation. Twenty-one modified Studer neobladder 
and 2 modified Y-shaped neobladder techniques for totally intracorporeal 3D 
laparoscopic ileal neobladder cases were performed using drawings and 
intra-operative images. An emphasis was made on different tips and tricks that 
can be applied when using ileum for the neobladder reconstruction, to avoid 
surgical complications and obtain optimal functional results.
RESULTS: The operations were performed in a mean time of 5 h, with a mean blood 
loss of 350 ml and grade II postoperative Clavien Dindo complications. The 23 
patients were discharged after a mean hospital stay of 21 days and had a 
functional ileal neobladder after a mean of 30 days. The results were monitored 
also on the long-term, taking into account functional results and possible 
complications from utilizing ileum as a urinary reservoir.
CONCLUSION: Resecting a digestive segment and using it as a urinary reservoir 
may lead to multiple complications. Therefore, laparoscopic technical 
adaptations and highly skilled surgical teams are required for performing a 
totally intracorporeal 3D laparoscopic orthotopic ileal neobladder 
reconstruction.

Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion is one 
of the most challenging procedures in urological surgery. Over the past 
15 years, this procedure has gained in popularity and the number of procedures 
performed has increased significantly. While ileal conduit remains the most 
common diversion, orthotopic neobladders are also formed in a few expert centres 
that have developed their technique for totally intracorporeal neobladder. The 
objective of this review is to summarise the techniques currently used to 
perform totally intracorporeal neobladder with a special focus on their 
functional outcomes, such as continence or sexual function. The techniques 
described are the Karolinska-modified Studer neobladder, the USC-modified Studer 
neobladder, the pyramid pouch, the Y-pouch, and the vesica Ileale Padovana, some 
trying to totally reproduce the steps of open surgery and others trying to 
simplify them. Functional outcomes vary depending on the technique performed. 
Standardisation in assessing outcomes is lacking, as well as objective outcome 
measurements with questionnaires or urodynamic assessments. Current evidence 
shows acceptable functional outcomes after totally intracorporeal neobladder 
construction, but larger prospective randomised series with longer follow-up, 
better defined outcomes, and more objective measurements are needed in the 
future.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The orthotopic neobladder and ileal conduit are the two most 
commonly utilized urinary diversions among patients undergoing radical 
cystectomy. Although orthotopic diversion offers several advantages, only 20% of 
patients nationally receive this diversion, with decreasing utilization over 
time. The purpose of this article is to review advantages of each diversion type 
and considerations in patient selection, review trends in diversion utilization 
and perioperative and functional outcomes, and examine recent studies evaluating 
methods of optimizing diversion selection and patient satisfaction and outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Decreasing utilization of orthotopic diversion has coincided 
with the increasing utilization of minimally invasive surgical techniques. A 
multicentre robotic series demonstrated a higher incidence of high-grade 
complications with intracorporeal diversion, reflecting the learning-curve 
associated with this technique. Patient satisfaction with urinary diversion is 
associated with informed decision-making and goal alignment. Ongoing quality of 
life studies is aiming to identify predictors of patient satisfaction with the 
selected urinary diversion and may help guide patient counselling.
SUMMARY: Given the potential advantages of orthotopic diversion, its decreasing 
use is a concerning trend. Elucidating patient goals and informed 
decision-making are critical to patient satisfaction. A patient-centred approach 
should be used when selecting the type of urinary diversion for a given patient.

Our aim was to illustrate our technique of sex-sparing (SS)-robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) in female patients receiving an intracorporeal 
neobladder (iN). From January 2013 to June 2018, 11 female patients underwent 
SS-RARC-iN at a single tertiary referral center. Inclusion criteria were a cT ≤ 
2 N0 M0 bladder tumor at baseline imaging (CT or MRI) and an absence of tumors 
in the bladder neck, trigone and urethra at TURB. Baseline, perioperative, and 
outcomes at one year were reported. The median operative time was 255 min and 
the median hospital stay was seven days. Low-grade Clavien complications 
occurred in four patients (36.3%), while high-grade complications were not 
observed in any. Seven patients (63.7%) had an organ-confined disease at the 
pathologic specimen; nodal involvement and positive surgical margins were not 
detected in any of the cases. At a median follow-up of 28 months (IQR 14-51), no 
patients developed new onset of chronic kidney disease stage 3b. After one year, 
daytime and nighttime continence rates were 90.9% and 86.4% respectively. 
Quality of life as well as physical and emotional functioning improved 
significantly over time (all p ≤ 0.04), while urinary symptoms and sexual 
function worsened at three months with a significant recovery taking place at 
one year (all p ≤ 0.04). Overall, 8 out of 11 patients (72.7%) were sexually 
active at the 12-month evaluation. In select female patients, SS-RARC-iN is an 
oncologically sound procedure associated with favorable perioperative and 
functional outcomes.

BACKGROUND: A higher prevalence of bladder cancer is reported in solid organ 
recipients, and advanced cancer requires radical cystectomy combined with 
urinary diversion. Surgery is technically challenging in kidney transplant 
recipients because of urinary tract abnormalities. Here, we describe the use of 
a robot-assisted approach in a kidney transplant recipient.
CASE PRESENTATION: The etiology of the patient's end-stage renal disease was 
bilateral hypoplastic kidney. The patient started to receive hemodialysis at 19 
years of age and underwent living-related kidney transplant at 23 years of age. 
Thirteen years later, he was diagnosed with invasive urothelial carcinoma and 
underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy with extracorporeal neobladder 
construction under open laparotomy. Surgery was indicated to enhance suture 
flexibility and dissection of the peribladder tissues. Although the patient had 
an intraperitoneal infection caused by leakage from the vesicourethral 
anastomosis site and required drainage of the abscess, his condition stabilized 
after antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSION: This case outlines the effectiveness of the robot-assisted approach 
in patients with urinary tract abnormalities, such as kidney transplant 
recipients.

Pembrolizumab Treatment and Pathologic Therapeutic Evaluation for Granulocyte 
Colony-stimulating Factor-producing Bladder Cancer: A Case Report and Literature 
Review.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing bladder cancer is a rare 
variant subtype of bladder cancer with a poor prognosis. Pembrolizumab has 
improved overall survival in bladder cancer and is widely used as a standard 
second-line treatment. However, no reports on G-CSF-producing cancer treated by 
pembrolizumab are available. We report a case of the pathologically evaluated 
antitumor effect of pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 immune checkpoint 
inhibitor antibody, in G-CSF-producing bladder cancer. A 53-year-old male 
patient underwent 4 courses chemotherapy with a combination of gemcitabine and 
carboplatin before a radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder. Four months after 
the surgery, local recurrence was detected in the pelvis and therefore 
pembrolizumab was used. One week after its administration, the patient showed 
increased mucus in his urine. A computed tomography scan and cystoscopy revealed 
a fistula between the ileum and the neobladder. He subsequently underwent 
partial ileectomy and repair of the neobladder-ileum fistula. 
Pathology-diagnosed tumor response to pembrolizumab in the metastatic tumor 
showed predominant infiltration by lymphocytes, unlike that in the primary 
bladder cancer. The patient has shown complete response and no recurrence at 1 
year after the beginning of treatment, and therapy is still continuing. Although 
many questions still remain regarding the treatment of G-CSF-producing bladder 
cancer, pathologic evaluation of the present case suggests that treatment with 
pembrolizumab may be one option for G-CSF-producing bladder cancer that has 
failed chemotherapy treatment, similar to non-G-CSF-producing bladder cancer.

PURPOSE: To compare quality of life and functional outcomes associated with 
orthotopic neobladder (ONB) and ileal conduit (IC) after anterior pelvic 
exenteration for bladder cancer in women, through a multicentric cross-sectional 
study.
METHODS: All women who have undergone an anterior pelvic exenteration associated 
with ONB or IC for a bladder cancer between January 2004 and December 2014 
within the three participating university hospital centers and that were still 
alive in February 2016 were included. Three distinct auto-administered 
questionnaires were submitted to the patients: the EORTC QLQ-C30, the EORTC 
QLQ-BLmi30 and the SF-12. Comparison of response to these questionnaires between 
women with ONB and those with IC were studied with Mann-Whitney U tests, with a 
statistically significant P-value set at<0.05. The primary endpoint was the 
"global health status" sub-score extracted from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. 
The secondary endpoints were the functional sub-scores and symptoms sub-scores 
obtained with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire as well as the sub-scores obtained 
with the EORTC QLQ-BLmi30 and the SF-12 questionnaires.
RESULTS: Forty women were included in the study (17 ONB, 23 IC). The primary 
endpoint was comparable between the ONB and IC women (83.3 vs. 66.7 P=0.22). 
Similarly, no significant statistical difference could be pointed between the 
ONB and IC women in terms of secondary endpoints.
CONCLUSION: The present study did not report any significance difference in 
terms of quality of life and functional outcomes between women with ONB and 
those with IC after pelvic exenteration for bladder cancer.

Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. Radical 
cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and a urinary diversion (UD) is the 
gold standard treatment of non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). 
Although ileal conduit is the standard and most commonly performed type of UD, 
more number of centers have recently started to perform orthotopic ileal 
neobladder (OIN). A novel OIN has been described in 2005 as the so-called 
"Leuven N-pouch", which combines the features of the commonly used Hautmann and 
Studer neobladders. Herein, we report our first experience with a case of Leuven 
N-pouch in our department, which was performed for a male patient with MIBC.

The objective was to describe our step-by-step technique for robot-assisted 
orthotopic "W" ileal neobladder (INB) for urinary diversion following radical 
cystectomy for oncological purpose, and to report the outcomes of this technique 
for the first six male patients treated at our center. Patients underwent 
robot-assisted radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer and had a "W" ileal 
neaobladder as urinary diversion. Our surgical technique is described step by 
step and video illustrated. Patients and operative data were collected and 
reported. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) 
self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the urinary, sexual and bowel 
functions outcomes at 90 days postoperatively. The mean operative time was 
475 min [420-525] and mean length of stay was 13 days [11-15]. No major 
complications occurred (Clavien grade ≥ 3). Regarding the continence four 
patients reported they leaked urine rarely or never and two patients having 
urine leak once a day. Two patients did not wear any pad, the four others 
reported using pad at night. Two patients reported urinary function as not a 
problem, one as a very small problem, two as a small problem and one as a 
moderate problem. These results from our six first cases using the technique 
described here are promising with interesting early functional outcomes. This 
has to be confirmed on larger cohort and with long-term follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To illustrate our refinement technique for robotic intracorporeal 
orthotopic Hautmann neobladder with adherence to open surgical principles and 
evaluate perioperative and functional outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal 
Hautmann orthotopic neobladder was performed by the same surgeon in 40 patients 
with bladder cancer from November 2017 to March 2019. Baseline demographics, 
pathologic data, 90-day complications, and functional outcomes at both 6 and 12 
months were evaluated with questionnaire and urodynamic analysis.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 14 months (range 4-20). Median operative time was 
320 (230-500) minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 300 (100-2000) mL. No 
conversion to the open technique was reported. The overall 90-day complication 
rate was 45%, and the high-grade complication rate was only 10%. The daytime 
satisfactory continence rate was 90% at both 6 months (30 patients) and 12 
months (20 patients), while the night-time satisfactory continence rate was 
76.7% and 80.0% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. One patient underwent 
clean intermittent catheterization. The cohort had minimal postvoid residual 
volume, normal compliance, and a mean capacity of 328.7 cm3 (range 170-500) at 6 
months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data indicate that robotic intracorporeal Hautmann 
neobladder configuration is a feasible surgical technique and can achieve a low 
pressure and sufficient capacity for satisfactory early voiding patterns. 
Refinement of the stepwise process can effectively decrease the time of the 
operation. Long-term functional and oncological outcomes remain to be evaluated 
with longer follow-up and more cases.

The objective of this study is to report the first multicentric Brazilian series 
and learning curve of robotic radical cystectomy (RARC) with related intra- and 
postoperative outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 37 RARC prospectively 
collected at four different centers in Brazil, from 2013 to 2019. We analyzed 
the patient's demographics, pathological tumor, and nodal status, as well as 
intra- and postoperative outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed with the 
IBM (SPSS version 25) software. Overall, 86% were male, and the median age was 
69 years. 83% had muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and 17% a high-grade, 
recurrent non-muscle-invasive tumor. The median operative time was 420 min with 
300 min as console time. Median blood loss was 350 ml and transfusion rate was 
10%. In 68% of the cases, we performed an intracorporeal Bricker urinary 
diversion, 24% intracorporeal neobladder, and 8% ureterostomy. Six patients 
(16%) had a Clavien 1-2, 8% had Clavien 3, 2.5% had a Clavien 4, and 5% had 
Clavien 5. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days. The final pathological 
exam pointed out pT0 in 16%, pT1 in 8%, pT2 in 32%, ≥ pT3 in 27%, and 16% pTis. 
95% had negative surgical margins. The survival at 30, 90, and 180 days was 98%, 
95%, and 95%, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first multicentric 
series of RARC reporting the learning curve in Brazil; even if still 
representing a challenging procedure, RARC could be safely and effectively faced 
by experienced surgeons at centers with high volumes of robotic surgery.

PURPOSE: In the present study, we evaluated the long-term results of modified 
Y-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder (Tanta pouch) with trans-mesenteric left 
retro-colic chimney.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 70 patients with invasive bladder cancer 
underwent radical cystectomy and modified Y-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder. 
(The left chimney elongated to pass to the left side through a window in the 
mesentery of the pelvic colon and the ureters were implanted directly end to 
side, in both chimneys after doing good spatulation.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period ranged between 7 and 10 years (mean 
7.8 years). 18 patients died during the period of follow-up. 6 months 
postoperatively, there was a spherical orientation of the pouch (The mean 
capacity was 542 ± 47 cm3) and the maximum intra-pouch pressure was 24 ± 3.2 cm 
H2O. Daytime continence was achieved in 93% of the patients and nighttime 
continence was achieved in 87%. Stress incontinence occurred in 15% and total 
incontinence in 2%. Renal function was stable in 93% of renal units. Stricture 
ureter was not recorded of any case. Of 14 renal units with preoperative dilated 
ureters, 5 units had improved postoperatively and the others had persistent 
reflux. 13 renal units (3 unilateral and 5 bilateral) with normal preoperative 
ureters had persistent postoperative reflux. Persistent reflux showed no 
influence on renal function.
CONCLUSION: Modified Y-shaper pouch is suitable for short, dilated ureters. 
Longitudinal orientation of the pouch facilitates ileo-urethral anastomosis, 
especially with short mesentery. Long-term follow-up for direct uretero-ileal 
anastomosis did not show deterioration of the renal function.

INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Radical Cystectomy (RC) with ileal urinary diversion is 
one of the most complex urological surgical procedure, and many Fast Track (FT) 
protocols have been described to reduce hospitalization, without increasing 
postoperatory complications. We present the one-year results of a dedicated 
protocol developed at a high volume centre.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FT protocol was designed after a review of the 
literature and a multidisciplinary collegiate discussion, and it was applied to 
patients scheduled to open RC with intestinal urinary diversion. To validate its 
feasibility, we compared its results with data collected from a 1:1 matched 
population of patients who had undergone the same surgical procedure, without 
the implementation of the FT protocol.
RESULTS: We enrolled in the FT group 11 (55%) patients scheduled to RC with 
ileal conduit diversion, and 9 patients (45%) scheduled to orthotopic neobladder 
(Studer) substitution, while a numerically equivalent population was enrolled in 
the control group, matched according to age at surgery, BMI, gender, ASA score, 
CCI, preoperative stage and type of urinary diversion. No statistically 
significant difference was found in terms of pre-operatory and intra-operatory 
domains. Median overall age was 71 years (Inter Quartile Range - IQR: 63-76) and 
mean operatory time was 276 ± 57 minutes. Hospitalization time was significantly 
reduced in the FT group, considering oralization and canalization items we found 
a significant advantage in the FT group. No statistically significant difference 
was found in the control of the post-operatory pain. We found no difference, in 
terms of both early and late complications ratio, among the two populations. 
Complications graded Clavien ≥ 3 were found in 4 patients of the control group 
(20%), while in only one patient (5%) in the Fast Track group, though this 
difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The Fast Track protocol developed in this study has proven to be 
effective in significantly reducing hospitalization time in patients submitted 
to RC with intestinal urinary diversion, without increasing post-operatory 
complications ratio.

Radical cystectomy (RC) is the gold standard for managing muscle-invasive and 
high-risknon-muscleinvasive bladder cancer, but is accompanied by non-negligible 
operative risk. The aim of this study is to identify preoperative variables to 
predict major perioperative complications after RC and to develop a nomogram 
using the cohort from multiple institutions in Japan. We retrospectively 
reviewed 668 patients who underwent open RC with ileal conduit or neobladder at 
Hokkaido University hospital and 20 affiliated institutions between 1997 and 
2010. Complications occurring within 90 days of surgery were graded using 
modified Clavien classification system. We defined modified Clavien grade 3 or 
more as major complications and performed univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses. Predictive accuracy of the nomogram was evaluated with the 
area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). A total of 528 
men and 140 women were included in this study. There were a total of 160/668 
patients (24%) with major perioperative complications. A multivariate model 
identified gender (OR : 1. 63, p=0. 04), cardiovascular comorbidity (OR : 1.48, 
p=0.03) and simultaneous nephroureterectomy (OR : 2.81, p=0. 01) as independent 
predictors. Using these 3 variables, a nomogram was developed with the AUC of 
0.58. Predictive performance of our nomogram showed only fair performance ; but 
at least, we identified male, cardiovascular comorbidity and simultaneous 
nephroureterectomy as independent predictors of perioperative major 
complications.

INTRODUCTION: Length of hospital stay (LOS) is considered as a key factor in 
estimating outcomes after radical cystectomy (RC) in urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
patients. We aimed to assess whether clinical perioperative (age, gender, type 
of urinary diversion technique) and histopathological factors [UC variant, 
primary tumor, node, metastasis (pTNM) staging] could be a determining factor 
for LOS, as well as its influence on overall survival (OS) in a single 
institution, retrospective cohort study.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included a total of 69 UC patients that had 
RC performed in our Department during November 2011 and October 2018. Regular 
LOS was considered arbitrarily up to 12 days. All factors were analyzed in 
relation to LOS, using the chi-square and the Mann-Whitney tests. Impact of LOS 
on survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and the Cox regression methods.
RESULTS: Age was associated to increased LOS (p=0.042), as well as the type of 
urinary diversion (p=0.003). Patients with complex diversion were found more 
frequently in the prolonged LOS group (ileal conduit p=0.006, Mainz pouch 
p=0.15, Camey neobladder p=0.517). Histopathologically, N stage had a 
significant association to LOS (p=0.044). Survival analysis showed decreased 
survival in the prolonged LOS group (p=0.653). Cox regression found no influence 
of LOS (p=0.653), advanced age (p=0.518) or type of urinary diversion on OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, the complexity of urinary diversion and lymph node 
involvement were found as associated factors for prolonged LOS in RC patients. 
The impact of LOS on survival is uncertain, requiring larger, in-depth studies.

No data are available on the surgical safety of radical cystectomy (RC) and 
pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) after the administration of checkpoint 
inhibitors. We aimed at reporting the first prospective rigorous assessment of 
perioperative outcomes after RC and extended PLND following neoadjuvant 
pembrolizumab in a contemporary cohort of patients with muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer (MIBC) enrolled in the PURE-01 trial. From February 2017 to June 2019, a 
total of 68 consecutive patients who received three courses of 200 mg 
pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 wk and were subsequently treated with either 
open or robot-assisted RC and PLND at a single high-volume tertiary referral 
center were identified. All men had prospectively collected data about intra- 
and postoperative outcomes. Postoperative complications were graded according to 
the Clavien-Dindo system. Perioperative data were prospectively and 
systematically collected during patient interviews at 90 d after surgery 
according to the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines Panel 
recommendations on reporting and grading complications. Overall, 52 (77%) versus 
16 (23%) patients underwent robot-assisted versus open RC, and 31 patients (46%) 
received an orthotopic neobladder. Median blood loss and length of stay were 
150 ml and 12 d, respectively. Overall, 52 (77%), 47 (69%), and 22 (32%) 
patients experienced any-grade complications, grade ≥2 complications, and 
readmission at 90 d, respectively. High-grade complications (defined as 
Clavien-Dindo ≥3a) were observed in 23 patients (34%). The most frequent 
complications were fever (n = 35, 52%) and ileus (n = 21, 31%). None of the 
patients experienced perioperative mortality at 90 d. Our data represent the 
first prospective evidence supporting the surgical safety of RC and PLND in 
patients with N0M0 MIBC who received neoadjuvant immunotherapy with 
pembrolizumab. PATIENT SUMMARY: The current study represents the first 
prospective evidence supporting the surgical safety of radical cystectomy and 
pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with nonmetastatic bladder cancer who 
received neoadjuvant immunotherapy with pembrolizumab.

(Objectives) Investigation of patient-reported outcome (PRO) after ileal 
neobladder for bladder cancer. (Patients and methods) Forty patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder between July 2007 and December 
2017 were asked to complete a questionnaire. PRO was evaluated using the Medical 
Outcomes Study Short Form-8 (SF-8) for general health-related quality of life 
(QOL) and the Bladder Cancer Index and the Japanese version of the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder for disease specific QOL. Patients were 
divided into two groups according to the postoperative period (early and late), 
and the differences in questionnaire results between the groups were evaluated. 
(Results) All scores on the SF-8 were over 50 points, exceeding the Japanese 
national standard of 50 points for all items. The physical and mental summary 
scores were also favorable. For disease-specific QOL, only daytime incontinence 
was significantly higher in the late group, with daytime incontinence two or 
more times per week at 42.1%, compared to 20.0% in the early group (P=0.0403). A 
comparison of daytime urinary incontinence in four groups during the 
postoperative period showed that urinary incontinence was least frequent among 
patients between 64 and 101 months after surgery; patients in this group were 
also the youngest in age at the time of surgery. (Conclusions) Cross-sectional 
analysis of PRO revealed that patients with ileal neobladder had good general 
health-related QOL after surgery, but urinary incontinence was a significant 
problem.

A six-month-old child was admitted into our center with complaint of 
hydronephrosis in June 2018. He was diagnosed as embryoid rhabdomyosarcoma after 
cystoscopy with biopsy. After 22 Gy radiotherapy and 4 cycles chemotherapy 
(VAC), robot-assisted radical cystectomy was performed. The orthotopic 
neobladder was reconstructed with sigmoid colon and bilateral ureter was 
reimplanted in Politano-Leadbetter technique. The patient was discharged after 
14 days and chemotherapy was continued. Recent ultrasound examination showed 
that his maximal bladder capacity had increased to 120 mL, and intravenous 
urography revealed no urine leakage. The tumor is in good control and the 
neobladder works well.

Men are at a higher risk of developing bladder cancer, but women present with 
more advanced disease and have more unfavourable outcomes. Although 
epidemiologic and genetical studies have underlined the multifactorial aetiology 
and gender-related differences of bladder cancer, there is lack of 
evidence-based recommendation for gender-specific management of bladder cancer. 
We summarize the evidence and most recent findings on gender-specific 
differences in bladder cancer incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome, 
spotlighting the gender disparities in genetic and hormonal risk factors, pelvic 
anatomy, diagnostic setting and surgical choices. We reviewed the literature 
published on PubMed between 1981 and 2018. Males have a threefold to fourfold 
higher risk of bladder cancer as compared to females; however, women have higher 
stage-for-stage mortality, being diagnosed with more advanced disease, mostly 
due to a delay in haematuria evaluation. Numerous studies indicate an increased 
risk of disease recurrence or progression in women with non-muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer treated with trans-urethral resection, with or without 
intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy, compared to males. In particular, 
recent molecular evidence show that there is an excess of female Ta mutant 
tumours. At the time of radical cystectomy, women have a significantly longer 
length of hospital stay, operative time, higher blood loss and higher 90-day 
mortality and perioperative complication rate. Moreover, females are less likely 
to receive a continent diversion. Future research should guarantee greater 
inclusion of women in trials and focus on improving the effectiveness of 
therapies in women, perhaps exploring different therapeutic approaches in men 
and women. Specific data on functional and oncological outcomes can be analysed 
to define predictive factors able to guide the surgeon in decisions based on 
evidence. It is urgently needed to limit gender-related discrepancies in early 
diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. Public awareness and bladder cancer 
female patients' consciousness on gender inequalities must be similarly uprisen.

CONTEXT: In bladder cancer patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC), 
controversy exists regarding the impact of the annual hospital volume (HV) 
and/or surgeon volume (SV) on oncological outcomes and quality of care.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was performed to evaluate the impact of HV and SV 
on clinical outcomes. Primary outcomes included in-hospital, 30-d, and 90-d 
mortality. Secondary outcomes included complications, long-term survival, 
positive surgical margin rate, lymphadenectomy performance, length of hospital 
stay, neobladder performance, and blood loss/transfusion rate.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials were searched. Comparative studies published after the year of 
2000 including patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer were eligible for 
inclusion. Partial cystectomy was an exclusion criterion. Risk of bias (RoB) 
assessment was performed according to the ROBINS-1 tool.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: After screening of 1190 abstracts, 39 studies recruiting 549 
542 patients were included. All studies were retrospective observation cohort 
studies (level of evidence 3). Twenty-two studies reported on HV only, six 
studies on SV only, and 12 on both. Higher HV, specifically an HV of >10, was 
associated with improved primary and secondary outcomes in most studies. In 
addition, there is some evidence that an HV of >20 improves outcomes. For SV, 
limited and conflicting data are reported. Most studies had moderate to high 
RoB. The results were synthesized narratively.
CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the lower level of evidence, HV is likely associated 
with in-hospital, 30- and 90-d mortality, as well as the secondary outcomes 
assessed. Based on this study, the European Association of Urology 
Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer Guideline Panel recommends 
hospitals to perform at least 10, and preferably >20, RCs annually or refer the 
patient to a center that reaches this number. For SV, limited and conflicting 
data are available. The available evidence suggests HV rather than SV to be the 
main driver of perioperative outcomes.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Current literature suggests that the number of bladder removal 
operations per hospital per year is associated with postoperative survival as 
well as the quality of care provided.

INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy and radical pelvic surgery, either radical 
cystectomy or pelvic exenteration, is the golden standard treatment for 
infiltrating bladder carcinoma, as well as advanced or recurrent cervical, 
vulvar, vaginal and endometrial cancer. However, due to the poor radiation 
sensitivity of the cervix and vagina, a high-radiation dose is required, leading 
to early and/or late onset urogenital complications in approximately 50% of the 
patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: The following case report describes a 64-year-old native 
Russian woman presenting a relapse of a vaginal cuff squamous cell carcinoma, 
who underwent a laterally extended endopelvic resection (LEER) followed by a 
neobladder reconstruction based on the Indiana pouch (IP) technique. The process 
is described here step by step.
DISCUSSION: Indiana pouch urinary diversion was based on thorough research, the 
reproducibility of the technique, our urologist's experience with the Indiana 
Pouch, as well the lower rate of complications published in various separate 
series.
CONCLUSION: Indiana pouch is a successful continence urinary reservoir with a 
reproductible technique, however long-term observation is needed.

Renal transplantations in augmented bladders or urinary diversions are rare, 
accounting for only 1-2% of all renal transplantations. In most cases 
a dysfunctional lower urinary tract is the cause of end-stage renal disease in 
these patients; therefore recovery of the lower urinary tract is mandatory for 
long-term graft survival. Usually, urinary diversion is timed several months 
prior to renal transplantation. Beside renal transplantations into an ileum 
conduit, renal transplantations in continent urinary diversions have become 
increasingly popular. The most frequent complications are bacteriuria and 
urinary tract infections, which usually do not lead to graft loss when treated 
correctly with antibiotics. Long-term outcome of renal transplantations in 
urinary diversions is comparable to transplantations in healthy native bladders.

Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction is a continent urinary diversion 
procedure that may be performed in a patient with bladder cancer following a 
radical cystectomy. The selection of a patient for an ONB reconstruction is 
strict as not everyone may be suitable to undergo this complex surgery. Patients 
must be not only mentally competent but also physically dexterous enough to 
allow for appropriate neobladder training post-procedure, to achieve best 
urinary function. However, even with a carefully chosen patient population, 
various complications specific to ONB reconstruction may result. Metabolic 
acidosis may result from electrolyte shifts, resulting in secondary 
complications such as bone demineralization and urinary calculi. In addition, 
nutritional deficiencies may result from the use of a transposed intestinal 
segment for the fashioning of the reservoir. A widely used outcome measure when 
assessing for ONB reconstruction is continence. With a strict neobladder 
training regimen, daytime continence may be achieved in roughly 70% of patients 
post-ONB procedure. This number may increase over the course of several years, 
although may decrease in up to 20 years of follow-up. Similarly, quality of life 
(QoL) measures have been widely studied, and current literature suggests 
slightly better QoL achieved with ONB compared to other urinary diversion 
procedures. Of note, the tools used to assess continence and QoL vary between 
studies, limiting the interpretability of the summarized data. Nevertheless, ONB 
reconstruction is a procedure that is still evolving, with ongoing modifications 
that can reduce complications and improve patient urinary function.

INTRODUCTION: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concepts are implemented in 
various surgical disciplines. For patients undergoing radical cystectomy, 
prospective data are still rare. In the year 2014, our group could prove 
significant benefits of ERAS for these patients in a prospective randomized 
study compared to a conservative regimen.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term follow-up results of ERAS concepts in patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
METHODS: Of the 101 patients who had initially prospectively been randomized to 
ERAS or a conservative regimen, 35 patients could be included in the study. 
Median follow-up time was 83 months. Primary end point assessed quality of life. 
Secondary end points were cancer-specific survival and overall survival.
RESULTS: Five to seven years after the initial inclusion to the study, no 
significant difference regarding quality of life parameters was detected (p 
values range between 0.112 and 0.970). Continence status in patients with 
neobladder showed no significant differences between ERAS and conservative 
regimens (p = 0.785). Cancer-specific survival in the ERAS group did not differ 
significantly from that in the conservative group (49 vs. 58%, p = 0.725).
CONCLUSIONS: While ERAS represents an excellent way to improve postoperative 
reconvalescence and quality of life in the short-term follow-up, our data do not 
support the idea that there is also a long-term effect in terms of quality of 
life issues.

Objective: To establish experimental porcine model of reconstruction the 
neobladder by ileal seromuscular with transplantation of autologous peritoneum. 
Methods: This was an animal experiment carried out from January to April 2018 at 
animal center of Guizhou Medical University. Randomly 6 experimental female 
porcines were chosen, and their body weight was 28 to 33 kg. By intravenous 
anesthesia, the transplantation of autologous peritoneum for bladder 
reconstruction operation was carried out by transplanting the peritoneum onto an 
ileum segment which mucosa and submucosa had been removed. These flaps were used 
to mend and reconstruct the neobladder by suturing with edge of the detective 
bladder. After removal of ureteral catheters and balloon catheter at day 5 and 
day 7 respectively, voiding behavior was monitored, and animals were euthanized 
at week 12 for routine pathology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopic 
examinations. Results: Six porcines underwent reconstruction, but no one lost to 
complications such as peritonitis, ileus and urinary fistula. Voiding behavior 
was normal, and urine was clear in all animals after removal of catheters. At 
autopsy, reconstructed bladders were healthy. Pathological examination showed 
the part of reconstruction had been covered by continuous urothelium while the 
peritoneum disappeared and showed no ileal mucosa regrowth and residual. 
Scanning electron microscope showed that the transitional cells of neobladder 
were complete and orderly, and urothelium around suture border was continuous 
and no malposition. Conclusion: In this experimental porcine model, 
reconstruction bladder by autologous peritoneum and ileal seromuscular flaps is 
an ideal approach.

OBJECTIVE: Proper techniques used in procedures might play an important role in 
reducing ureteroileal anastomosis stricture (UIAS) for patients undergoing 
orthotopic neobladder. The present study was to evaluate the efficacy of 
internal double-J stent versus external ureteral catheter on UIAS for patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of the literature referring to the topic was 
performed on 10th January 2019 in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar, by using 
key words as radical cystectomy, orthotopic neobladder, stricture, stenosis. The 
Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.3 software was employed for data analysis. The 
incidence of UIAS was evaluated as primary outcome.
RESULTS: Five studies were included eventually. The incidence of UIAS was lower 
in the group of internal double-J stent than that in the group of external 
ureteral catheter (odds ratio [OR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.97; p = 0.04) with a 
low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). Besides, internal double-J stent group had a trend 
of a shorter length of stay than external ureteral catheter group.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present meta-analysis, internal double-J stent 
placement was associated with a lower incidence of UIAS than external ureteral 
catheter for patients undergoing orthotopic neobladder. In addition, a trend of 
a shorter hospital stay was also detected, thus, internal double-J stent 
placement may be favored in the view of the enhanced recovery after surgery 
(ERAS).

BACKGROUND: To optimize outcomes reporting after robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder (iON), we propose a 
novel trifecta, aimed to overcome the available pentafectas that neglect 
functional outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained RARC-iON dataset 
was performed. Baseline demographic, clinical, pathologic, perioperative and 
follow-up data were collected. Trifecta was defined as the coexistence of 
daytime urinary continence, Clavien-Dindo ≥3 complication-free and 
recurrence-free status, all assessed at 1 year. Kaplan-Meier method assessed the 
role of trifecta achievement in predicting overall survival (OS) probabilities. 
Univariable and multivariable regression analyses identified predictors of 
trifecta achievement. The predictive accuracy of trifecta and other pentafectas 
on 3-year OS probability was plotted with receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analyses.
RESULTS: The trifecta rate was 53% while 62% and 47% of patients achieved the 
University of Southern California (USC-P) and PROMETRICS group (PROM-P) 
pentafectas, respectively. On tertile analysis, both trifecta (P=0.011) and 
USC-P (P=0.043) rates significantly increased with surgical experience, while 
PROM-P did not (P=0.204). On ROC analysis, trifecta was the only significant 
predictor of 3-year OS probability (AUC=0.69, 95% CI:0.55-0.82; P=0.018). On 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients achieving trifecta displayed significantly 
higher OS probability (P=0.032); adjusted for covariates, each incremental case 
was associated with a 2% increased probability (OR: 1.02) of achieving trifecta 
on multivariable regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: Learning curve in RARC-iON has a significant impact on achievement 
of trifecta. This tool combines accurate measurement of surgical proficiency 
with an independent predictive value in assessing 3-year OS probabilities.

PURPOSE: Ileal neobladder construction is a common choice for orthotopic urinary 
diversion following radical cystectomy. We investigated risk factors for 
metabolic acidosis during the early recovery period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study relied on retrospectively collected data on 
345 patients who underwent inpatient rehabilitation after radical cystectomy and 
ileal neobladder construction for bladder cancer between January 2014 and March 
2017. Acid-base status, use of sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis 
and continence status were evaluated at the beginning and end of 3 weeks of 
inpatient rehabilitation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify risk factors associated with the development of metabolic 
acidosis.
RESULTS: At the start of rehabilitation a median of 29 days after surgery (IQR 
23-37) 200 patients (58.0%) had metabolic acidosis. During the inpatient 
rehabilitation period the need for oral sodium bicarbonate replacement due to 
acidosis increased significantly from 45.2% to 86.7% of patients (p <0.001) 
while urine loss measured by a 24-hour pad test decreased significantly from a 
median of 387 (IQR 98-918) to 88 gm (IQR 5-388, p <0.001). The median base 
excess was within the normal range (-1.2 mmol/l, IQR -2.4 - 0.0) at the end of 
inpatient rehabilitation. Decreased urinary leakage was identified as an 
independent risk factor for metabolic acidosis.Conclusions:The risk of metabolic 
acidosis after neobladder construction correlated with continuously improved 
continence in the early recovery period. Therefore, during this period the 
acid-base status should be assessed more frequently to identify metabolic 
acidosis.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term complications, 
urodynamics, and quality of life (QoL) of patients after orthotopic ileal 
neobladder with orthotopic ureteral reimplantation to enrich clinical data and 
provide a basis for clinical use of this surgery.
METHODS: Between January 2007 and January 2013, 72 consecutive patients who 
underwent spiral ileal neobladder following radical cystectomy were enrolled. 
The neobladder was created using a modified Camey-II technique. Complications 
were reviewed and staged according to Clavien-Dindo classification and evaluated 
in long-term follow-up. Urodynamics were performed, and QoL was assessed by the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Bladder Cancer (FACT-BL) instrument.
RESULTS: The total follow-up time was 60 months, and the total survival rates at 
3 and 5 years after surgery were 76.4% (55/72) and 65.3% (47/72), respectively. 
There were 34 (47.2%) early complications in 23 (31.9%) patients and 42 (58.3%) 
late complications in 35 (48.6%) patients. The total satisfactory control rates 
were 69.1% and 66.0% at 3 and 5 years after the surgery, respectively. 
Urodynamic studies were performed in some patients, and the receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis showed that pressure at maximum capacity, 
compliance, and post void residual urine had predictive value for mortality 
(P < 0.05). The total FACT-BL scores of patients at 1, 3, and 5 years 
postoperation were 125.0 ± 15.2, 127.0 ± 16.2, and 120.6 ± 13.5, respectively, 
and it decreased at 5 years postoperation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Spiral ileal neobladder with orthotopic ureteral reimplantation 
offers satisfactory long-term results, and urodynamic monitoring might have 
prognostic value.

AIM: to improve the results of radical cystectomy by optimization of patient 
preparation for surgery and early postoperative care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients who underwent radical cystectomy 
and either orthotopic ileal neobladder or ileal conduit formation were included 
in the study. Brikkers operation was performed in 92 patients (76% men and 24% 
women) aged from 39 to 83 years, while in 44 patients (97.7% men, 2.3% women) 
aged from 32 to 75 years the Studer ileal neobladder was created. All patients 
underwent preoperative comprehensive examinations in order to determine type and 
extent of surgical treatment.
RESULTS: A complication rate after radical cystectomy with urine derivation 
using bowel segment was 49.2%. Mortality rate in early postoperative period was 
3.9%.
CONCLUSION: An algorithm of postoperative care after radical cystectomy with 
formation of either orthotopic neobladder or ileal conduit and consideration of 
comorbid status and preparation which we have used in clinical practice was 
developed. According to the results, after implementation of algorithm of 
management in preoperative and early postoperative period a decrease in 
complications and mortality rate has been found.

Objective: To report the trends in quality of life (QoL) reporting for radical 
cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion (UD) over the last four decades, as RC for 
bladder cancer is associated with significant morbidity and QoL issues. Material 
and methods: We searched PubMed, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval 
System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane library for 
published studies from January 1980 to January 2017 in the English language. We 
divided the published articles into three time periods: period-1 (1980-1997), 
period-2 (1998-2007) and period-3 (2008-2017). Results: A total of 85 QoL 
studies (8417 patients) were identified, of which 3347 (39.8%) patients had an 
ileal conduit (IC), 1078 (12.8%) had a continent UD (CD), 3264 (38.8%) had a 
neobladder (NB), and in the remaining 728 (8.6%) the type of UD was not 
specified. Whilst there were 15, 24 and 41 studies in period-1, period-2 and 
period-3 respectively, two (13%), 20 (83%) and 37 (90%) used a validated QoL 
tool; and none, six (25%) and 23 (56%) used a urology specific QoL tool during 
these three time periods. Similarly, the number of prospective studies increased 
from one (7%) to four (17%) and 14 (34%) in these three time periods. The 
proportion of reported IC patients reduced from 65% (784 patients) to 36% (899) 
and 35% (1664) from period-1 to period-3, whereas the proportion of NB patients 
increased from 4.5% (54) to 44% (1105) and 44% (2105). Over the last few years 
there have been QoL studies on laparoscopic and robotic IC and NB UDs. 
Conclusion: Our review suggests an increasing use of validated, bladder 
cancer-specific questionnaires with UD-specific constructs. Abbreviations: BCI:

PURPOSE: Early rehabilitation (ER) after radical cystectomy (RC) seems to be 
crucial for quality of life, education and prevention of complications after 
hospital discharge. We investigated an inpatient ER setting for bladder cancer 
(BC) patients.
METHODS: In total, 103 BC patients who underwent ileum neobladder reconstruction 
were included. The major issues from the patients' point of view, functional 
outcome parameters and complications during ER were analysed. A Wilcoxon signed 
rank test was used to compare body mass index (BMI) and diurnal as well as 
nocturnal use of urinary pads before and after ER.
RESULTS: At the beginning of ER, the median Karnovsky performance scale score 
was 70% (interquartile range [IQR] 70-90%) and the mean BMI was 25.8 kg/m2 (IQR 
21.9-27.9). The 4 most common complaints were urinary incontinence (80.6%), 
general weakness (73.8%), urinary mucus (49.5%) and mental distress (44.7%). 
During the programme, 28.2% of patients had a urinary tract infection requiring 
antibiotics and 15.5% presented a symptomatic acidosis. Median diurnal use of 
urinary pads significantly decreased during ER (4 vs. 3; p < 0.001). At the end 
of the ER programme, 76.0, 54.8 and 30.8% of the patients indicated an 
improvement of their physical capacity, incontinence and psychological distress 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the need for postoperative rehabilitation 
after RC. Further investigations should compare outcome parameters to ambulatory 
and outpatient ER models.

PURPOSE: Patients who undergo cystectomy due to bladder cancer can elect an 
ileal conduit or a neobladder for urinary diversion. Decision regret related to 
this choice is an important and undesirable patient reported outcome. Our 
objective was to compare the severity of decision regret experienced by patients 
with a neobladder vs an ileal conduit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort study of 
patients who underwent cystectomy from 2013 to 2015. We applied multivariable 
linear regression to examine associations of the urinary diversion method 
(neobladder vs ileal conduit) with decision regret measured with the DRS 
(Decision Regret Scale) 6 and 18 months after cystectomy. Covariates included 
demographic and clinical characteristics, health care utilization and 
complications after cystectomy, quality of life and factors related to the 
decision making process, including informed and shared decision making, and goal 
concordance.
RESULTS: Of the 192 patients in our cohort 141 received an ileal conduit and 51 
received a neobladder. We observed no significant difference in the DRS score in 
patients with a neobladder vs an ileal conduit at 6 or 18 months (b=-1.28, 95% 
CI -9.07-6.53, vs b=-1.55, 95% CI -12.48-9.38). However, informed decision 
making was negatively related to decision regret at 6 and 18 months (b=-13.08, 
95% CI -17.05--9.11, and b=-8.54, 95% CI -4.26--2.63, respectively). Quality of 
life was negatively associated with decision regret at 18 months (b=-5.50, 95% 
CI -8.95--2.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with cystectomy who were more informed about 
bladder reconstruction options experienced less regret independent of the method 
selected. Efforts to inform and prepare patients for the bladder reconstruction 
decision may help prevent decision regret.

Objectives: To describe our surgical technique of robotic ureteroileal 
reimplantation (RUIR) for ureteroileal anastomosis strictures with the use of 
near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIFI) after transnephrostomic antegrade 
injection of indocyanine green in patients previously treated with 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder. 
Materials and Methods: From March 2015 to December 2017, 10 consecutive patients 
underwent RUIR in our tertiary referral center. All patients previously 
underwent percutaneous nephrostomy and at least one antegrade stenting and 
stricture dilatation attempt. Clinical data were prospectively collected into 
our institutional dataset. Both perioperative and functional outcomes were 
assessed. Results: Median time from robotic cystectomy to ureteroileal 
anastomosis strictures diagnosis was 5 months (interquartile range [IQR] 2-6). 
Median stricture length was 1.5 cm (IQR 1-2). Median operative time was 140 
minutes (IQR 81-155), and median length of stay was 5 days (IQR 3-9). Two 
patients experienced Clavien grade 2 complications (urinary tract infection 
requiring antibiotics and blood transfusion, respectively). One patient 
underwent ileum resection and anastomosis due to bowel perforation (Clavien 
IIIb). At a median follow-up of 19 months (IQR 14-39), one patient developed a 
stricture recurrence. No patient developed worsening of renal function (newly 
onset chronic kidney disease stage 3b-4). Conclusions: Robotic reimplantation 
for ureteroileal anastomosis strictures is a safe and highly effective 
procedure, with a high success rate and excellent perioperative and functional 
outcomes. NIFI provides an easy guide to identify and progressively dissect the 
ureter.

    Int J Urol. 2019 Nov;26(11):1042-1043.

The current status of robot-assisted radical cystectomy was reviewed 16 years 
after the initial robot-assisted radical cystectomy for the treatment of 
invasive bladder cancer. Articles associated with robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy and written in English were selected from the PubMed database from 
January 2003 to February 2019. The present review article focused on the 
distribution of robot-assisted radical cystectomy, patient selection, 
preoperative management, surgical technique, lymph node dissection, urinary 
diversion, recurrence pattern, oncological outcomes, cost, learning curve, 
complications and educational programs. A total of 400 articles were divided 
according to the country of the first author's affiliation. The USA was the most 
dominant at 198 (50%), whereas the number of articles from the countries 
belonging to the Urological Association of Asia was 15 (3.8%) for China, 17 
(4.3%) for South Korea, 10 (2.5%) for Japan, eight (2%) for Taiwan, eight (2%) 
for Turkey and one (0.2%) for Iran. The percentage of robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy carried out is increasing, and intracorporeal urinary diversion and 
ileal neobladder are also frequently carried out. With a refined technique being 
performed in high-volume centers, robot-assisted radical cystectomy has 
contributed to the reduction in transfusion rate, length of stay and severe 
complications; however, it has not yet shown any cancer-specific survival 
benefits. Robot-assisted radical cystectomy is not fully spread throughout the 
Urological Association of Asia. Further investigation with respect to worldwide 
results is needed to prove the real benefit of robot-assisted radical cystectomy 
regarding low morbidity, reduced total medical cost, and survival benefit. In 
the era of precision medicine, appropriate drug and surgery will be given based 
on each genetic profile.

INTRODUCTION: Open radical cystectomy (ORC) is the gold standard technique for 
carcinologic cystectomies. Robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) was 
introduced in 2003 and its development is booming.
OBJECTIVE: To compare ORC and RARC with totally intracorporal (IC) orthotopic 
neobladder (ONB) reconstruction, in terms of perioperative outcomes, morbidity, 
functional results and quality of life (Qol).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February 2010 to February 2017, a French 
multicentric, prospective study on patients who had a RC and ONB reconstruction 
for bladder cancer was performed. All patients completed the following 
questionnaires: the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) generic (QLQ-C30) and the bladder cancer specific instruments 
(QLQ-BLM30). To assess urinary symptoms, patients also completed the Urinary 
Symptom Profile questionnaire (USP) and a three-day voiding diary. Patients were 
divided in two groups: ORC and RARC.
RESULTS: We included 72 patients: 55 in the ORC group (76,4%) and 17 (33,6%) in 
the RARC group. Operative time was longer in RARC group (median 360 vs 300min; 
P<0.001) but length of stay was 5 days shorter (median 12 vs 17 days; P<0,05). 
Patients in RARC group had less blood transfusion (0 vs 23.6%; P<0.05), but a 
higher rate of uretero-ileal anastomosis stenosis and eventration at long term 
(respectively 25.5 vs 3.6% et 23 vs 2%; P<0.05). No statistical differences were 
found concerning quality of life items and functional results between the 
groups.
CONCLUSION: RARC with totally IC ONB reconstruction lead to less perioperative 
morbidity with a reduced rate of blood transfusion and a reduced hospital length 
of stay. At long term, RARC could provide higher rates of uretero-ileal stenosis 
and eventration. RARC and ORC do not have any differences in terms of functional 
outcomes and Qol at long term after ONB reconstruction.

PURPOSE: To report survival outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy 
(RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) for 
recurrent/muscle-invasive non-metastatic bladder cancer.
METHODS: Prospectively maintained databases were queried for "robotic cystectomy 
AND ICUD". Patients treated after October 2013 and those treated without 
curative intent were excluded. Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot 
stage-specific survival outcomes, computed at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. 
Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses assessed predictors of 
recurrence-free (RFS), cancer-specific (CSS) and overall (OS) survival.
RESULTS: 113 consecutive patients were included, mostly men (82%). Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy was performed in 23% of cases, median lymph node (LN) yield was 36 
(IQR 28-45) and the rate of positive surgical margins (PSM) was 8%. Orthotopic 
ileal neobladder was the preferred ICUD type (57%). An organ-confined disease 
was observed in 51% of cases and 21% were pT0 on final histology. Overall, 
5-year RFS, CSS and OS probabilities were 58 ± 5%, 61 ± 5% and 54 ± 5%, 
respectively. At Kaplan-Meier method, tumor stage group was a significant 
predictor of survival probabilities (all p < 0.001) and this was confirmed at 
multivariable Cox regression analysis (RFS-OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.58-3.32; p < 0.001) 
(CSS-OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.3-2.53; p < 0.001) (OS-OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.46-3.14; 
p < 0.001). PSM status was associated to CSS (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.13-5.69; 
p = 0.024) and OS (OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.17-6.77; p = 0.021), but did not predict 
RFS (p = 0.062).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term oncologic outcomes after RARC with ICUD appear similar to 
recent robotic series with extracorporeal diversion and historical open 
experiences.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study is to compare the results and complications 
of muscle- invasive bladder cancer treatment using endovideo - surgical radical 
cycstectomy with orthotopic reservoir formation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016 years, 49 patients with muscle 
-invasive bladder cancer underwent endovideo-surgical treatment with orthotopic 
reservoir formation. 38 patients underwent laparoscopic radical cystectomy with 
extracorporeal ileal conduit urinary diversioon [ men - 28 (74%), women - 10 
(26%)], intracorporeal reservoir were perfomed in 11 cases [men - 8 (73%) and 
women - 3 (27%)]. The Modified Studer Ileal Neobladder (1st group) was performed 
in 32 ( 84%) cases, The Hautmann neobladder in 6 (16%) cases. During 
intracorporeal neobladder formation (2nd group) in all 11 cases Ileal Neobladder 
was created according to the methods of Karolinska Institutet, ( Sweden).
RESULTS: In the first group 7 (18%) patients had early postoperative 
complications: in 1 case - Anastomosis failure, 3 patients - Defect of 
ureteroileal anastomosis and in other 3 cases - Adhesive intestinal obstruction. 
There was an incidence of late postoperative complications in 6 (15%) cases: 1 
patient had exacerbation of chronic pyelonephritis, other 5 patients had 
stenosis of uretero-ileal anastomosis. Stenosis treatment methods were: in 3 
cases - Laser endoureterotomy, and 2 patients underwent Intestinal plastic 
surgery of the ureter. In the second group 5 (45%) patients had early 
postoperative complications: in 2 cases - Defect of ureteroileal anastomosis, 2 
patients had acute postoperative intestinal obstruction and in 1 case neobladder 
defect (multiple defects). In this group 4 (36%) patients had late postoperative 
complications: in 2 cases Stenosis of uretero-ileal anastomosis and other 2 - 
Active phase of chronic pyelonephritis.
CONCLUSION: Due to medical technologies development and endovideo-surgical 
equipment improving, it became possible to perform high-technological 
operations, such as a laparoscopic radical cystectomy with neobladder formation 
using different parts of intestine. To imptove the results technical 
difficulties, postoperative complications and durations of operations were 
appraised, and we reccomend to perform laparoscopic radical cystectomy with 
extracorporeal neobladder formation.

The aim of the study is to report surgical and early functional outcomes of 
first 100 patients undergoing robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with 
totally intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) in a single center. The main 
surgeon (A.P.) attended a modular training program at a referring center 
mentored by a worldwide-recognized robotic surgeon (P.W.). The program consisted 
of: (a) 10 h of theoretical lessons; (b) video session (c) step-by-step in vivo 
modular training. Each procedure was performed as taught, without any technique 
variation. Demographics, intra-operative data and post-operative complications, 
along with early functional outcomes, were recorded for each patient. We 
retrospectively evaluated the first consecutive 100 patients submitted to RARC 
with totally ICUD from July 2015 to December 2018. Median age at surgery was 
69 years (IQR 60-74). 52 (52%), 32 (32%), and 17 (17%) patients received 
orthotopic neobladder, ileal conduit and uretero-cutaneostomy, respectively. 
Median operative time was 410 min. A median number of lymph nodes retrieved were 
27 and median estimated blood loss was 240 mL with median hospitalization time 
of 7 days. All procedures were completed successfully without open conversion. A 
statistically significant improvement was found in the late (30-90 
post-operative days) post-operative complications (p = 0.02) and operative time 
for urinary derivation. At multivariate logistic regression model ASA score ≥ 3 
(OR = 4.2, p = 0.002) and number of lymph nodes retrieved (OR = 1.16, p = 0.02) 
were found to be predictors of 90-day complications. An adequate modular 
training is paramount to obtain successful results and reduce the learning curve 
of RARC, as demonstrated by our experience.

BACKGROUND: To determine the peri-operative safety and oncological value of 
robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) for older and younger patients in an 
initial Japanese RARC series.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the demographics, complications, 
peri-operative and oncological outcomes of 253 consecutive patients with bladder 
cancer who underwent RARC at 34 institutions in Japan between April 2009 and 
March 2017. The patients were assigned to groups according to ages at surgery of 
< 70 (younger; n = 125) and ≥ 70 (older; n = 128) years.
RESULTS: Mean Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.045) and the incidence of a 
history of previous abdominal surgery (p = 0.002) were significantly higher, 
whereas a history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.028) and neobladder 
(p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the older group. Mean total operative 
time was significantly shorter (p = 0.019) and mean estimated blood loss 
(p = 0.013) was significantly lower in the older group. Post-operative 
Grade ≥ II complications were comparable at 0-30, 31-90 and 91 days after 
surgery despite urinary tract associations. Rates of positive surgical margins 
and mean numbers of removed lymph nodes were comparable between the two groups. 
Although 5-year overall survival rates were significantly lower (p = 0.03) for 
older patients, 5-year cancer-specific (p = 0.10) and recurrence-free survival 
rates were comparable (p = 0.20) between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Using RARC potentially allows the application of less invasive 
procedures and cancer control for septuagenarian patients that are equivalent to 
those for younger patients.

INTRODUCTION: Neobladder urolithiasis is a rare but important long-term 
complication of orthotopic urinary diversion. It may be asymptomatic and can be 
discovered as an incidental finding on a radiological investigation. However, 
when symptoms occur, they may include lower abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, 
and lower urinary tract symptoms.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 63-year-old male patient with 
irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, lower abdominal fullness, urinary 
incontinence, fecaluria, and urinary loss from the left inguinal fold 12 years 
after a radical cystoprostatectomy with a orthotopic neobladder. Computed 
tomography scan and urethrocystography showed a distended pouch with multiple 
large stones, an enterovesical fistula, and neovesicocutaneous fistula. The 
fistulae were successfully managed conservatively with the placement of a Foley 
catheter. After 3 months, open cystolithotomy was performed and approximately 50 
stones with dimensions varying from 5 mm to 5 cm, with a total weight of 890 g, 
were removed. After a 1-year follow-up, the patient did not report pain, urinary 
tract infections, or symptoms suggestive of fistula and imaging evaluation 
confirmed no recurrence of neobladder stones.
CONCLUSION: Neobladder stones may present with various symptoms. Our patient had 
irritative lower urinary tract symptoms, lower abdominal fullness, urinary 
incontinence, fecaluria, and urinary loss from the left inguinal fold 12 years 
after a radical cystoprostatectomy with a orthotopic neobladder. Our experience 
demonstrates that open cystolithotomy is an effective intervention for the 
removal of large stones in neobladder.

PURPOSE: The choice of urinary diversion at cystectomy is a life altering 
decision. Patient decision aids are clinical tools that promote shared decision 
making by providing information about management options and helping patients 
communicate their values. We sought to develop and evaluate a patient decision 
aid for individuals undergoing cystectomy with urinary diversion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the IPDAS (International Patient Decision Aids 
Standards) to guide a systematic development process. A literature review was 
performed to determine urinary diversion options and the incidence of outcomes. 
We created a prototype using the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. A 
10-question survey was used to assess patient decision aid acceptability among 
patients, allied health professionals and urologists. The primary outcome was 
acceptability of the patient decision aid.
RESULTS: Ileal conduit and orthotopic neobladder were included as primary 
urinary diversion options because they had the most evidence and are most 
commonly performed. Continent cutaneous diversion was identified as an 
alternative option. Outcomes specific to ileal conduit were stomal stenosis and 
parastomal hernia. Outcomes specific to neobladder were daytime and nighttime 
urinary incontinence and urinary retention. Acceptability testing was completed 
by 8 urologists, 9 patients and 1 advanced practice nurse. Of the respondents 
94% reported that the language was appropriate, 94% reported that the length was 
adequate and 83% reported that option presentation was balanced. The patient 
decision aid met all 6 IPDAS defining criteria, all 6 certification criteria and 
21 of 23 quality criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: We created a novel patient decision aid to improve the quality of 
decisions made by patients when deciding among urinary diversion options. 
Effectiveness testing will be performed prospectively.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy (RC) is one of the most complex and morbid 
surgical procedures in urology, that is not devoid of postoperative 
complications. Minimally invasive surgery, and especially robot-assisted RC 
(RARC) has emerged as an alternative to open RC (ORC) in an attempt to minimize 
surgical morbidity and facilitate the surgical approach. The aim of this paper 
was to present the current knowledge on the oncological efficacy and 
complication outcomes of RARC.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A non-systematic review on all relevant studies with the 
keywords "Radical cystectomy," "Open," "Robot-assisted," "Complications," 
"Recurrence," "Survival," "Neobladder," "Potency," "Continence" and 
"Intracorporeal" was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, American 
Urological Association (AUA), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and 
European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: RARC shows similar lymph node yields and positive surgical 
margin rates as well as perioperative complication outcomes compared with ORC. 
RARC exhibits significantly less blood loss and less intra- and postoperative 
blood transfusion. Moreover, survival and recurrence rates are not related to 
the surgical approach. Finally, RARC seems to be more expensive and has a longer 
operating time compared to the open technique.
CONCLUSIONS: As current evidence shows, RARC seems as a technically feasible and 
safe procedure, providing equivalent perioperative and oncological results 
compared to ORC. More prospective, randomized-controlled trials are necessary to 
draw definitive conclusions on all comparative aspects.

PURPOSE: Current guidelines recommend confirming a negative urethral margin 
prior to orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. We investigated our rate of 
urethral positive margins and recurrence in the absence of intraoperative frozen 
section.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and pathological 
data on 357 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary 
diversion without intraoperative frozen section. At a median followup of 27 
months the rates of positive urethral margins and urethral recurrence were 
tabulated. Differences in overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with 
a positive urethral margin were analyzed by Cox regression to generate the HR 
with the 95% CI.
RESULTS: We identified 6 urethral recurrences (1.6%) during followup. The 
urethral recurrence rate was not higher in patients with a positive urethral 
margin (p=0.22). In the 15 patients with positive urethral margins overall 
survival was unchanged (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24-4.04). When accounting for lymph 
node staging, recurrence-free survival was not significantly worse in patients 
with positive urethral margins (HR 2.33, 95% CI 0.95-5.73).
CONCLUSIONS: Omitting intraoperative frozen section prior to orthotopic 
neobladder reconstruction appears safe with a rate of urethral recurrence 
similar to that in historical series. It may allow for increased performance of 
orthotopic urinary diversions.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy with orthotopic urinary diversion is considered 
the gold standard for treatment of muscular invasive bladder cancer or high-risk 
nonmuscular invasive bladder cancer. The choice of orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction depends on the clinical outcomes of it and should be planned with 
the patients, especially the risk of incontinence.
METHODS: this study included 52 Egyptian patients underwent radical cystectomy 
and orthotopic neobladder reconstruction with sigmoid (25 patients) and ileal 
(27 patients) segments. Postoperative clinical outcomes between the sigmoid and 
ileal neobladder groups were compared.
RESULTS: In the present study, 12 intraoperative complications (6 in each group) 
and 19 postoperative complications (17 in sigmoid and 15 in ileal group) 
occurred; however, there was no significant difference in the incidence of 
intraoperative and postoperative complications between both groups. There were 
no significant differences in the continence status and spontaneous voiding 
between both groups. There were no significant differences in maximal flow rate 
and voided volume between both groups. Night voiding frequency in the ileal 
neobladder patients was significantly smaller than sigmoid neobladder patients. 
Free flowery showed a significant difference of voiding time and volume in favor 
of sigmoid neobladder group. Maximum urethral pressure and urethral closing 
pressure were significantly higher in ileal neobladder group.
CONCLUSIONS: Both types of neobladder reconstruction resulted in comparatively 
satisfactory outcomes; however, the voiding function in sigmoid neobladder group 
appeared to be more favorable than that in ileal neobladder group.

AIM: To compare surgical, functional and early survival outcomes for 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal orthotopic 
neobladder (ONB) reconstruction in patients age = 75 y to those in patients age 
< 75 y using Propensity Score Matching.
METHODS: We collected data from 15 patients age = 75 y from among 60 consecutive 
RARC with ONB reconstruction performed at our institution from January 2015 to 
July 2018. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon after modular 
training under the supervision of a skilled surgeon. Demographic, surgical, 
functional and survival data were prospectively collected and compared to the 
corresponding data from 15 patients from the same series age < 75 y, matched 
according to the ASA score, body mass index, clinical stage and associated 
carcinoma in situ using Propensity Score Matching.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with 
regard to preoperative parameters, such as ASA score, BMI and preoperative 
stage. The same homogeneity was found for intraoperative parameters, such as 
operation time, number of nodes retrieved and ONB time. The only statistically 
significant difference noted was in the percentage of nerve-sparing procedures, 
which was higher in the younger patient group (p < 0.001). The percentages of 
early and late postoperative complications were higher in the older patients, 
but the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, there were no 
differences among the two populations in terms of functional outcomes (daytime 
and nighttime continence, potency), or in either cancer-specific or overall 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: RARC with totally intracorporeal ONB diversion can be offered to 
older patients with an expectation of good surgical, functional and early 
survival outcomes, although further studies with a larger sample size will be 
needed to confirm these results.

OBJECTIVES: To compare perioperative outcomes and complications of robot 
assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with extracorporeal (ECUD) vs. intracorporeal 
urinary diversion (ICUD) for bladder cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective revision of 43 patients who underwent RARC 
for bladder cancer between 2015-2018 with at least 3 months of follow-up. The 
analysis included the initial series of RARC performed by one surgeon with 
extensive experience in open radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients, 40 men (93%) and 3 women (7%), with a median age 
of 65 years (44-83) and mean follow-up of 27.7 months (±20.1) underwent RARC. A 
ECUD was performed in 22 cases (51%), of whom 10 were ileal conduits (45.5%) and 
12 neobladders (54.5), and ICUD in 21 cases (49%), of whom 14 were ileal 
conduits (66.7%) and 7 neobladders (33.3%). Clinical and preoperative 
characteristics were similar in both groups. The median operative time was 360 
minutes (240-540) and length of hospital stay was 12 days (7-73). Thirty-five 
patients (81%) had postoperative complications, of whom 10 (23%) were major. 
Operative time, peroperative complications, pathological stage, positive 
margins, and number of lymph nodes removed did not significantly differ among 
groups. Patients who underwent ECUD had a higher rate of uretero-ileal 
strictures than those with ICUD (45.5% vs. 14.3%, P=.026). Among the 
neobladders, the ECUD developed a higher rate of urethro-neobladder stricture 
than the ICUD (33% vs. 0%, P=.044).
CONCLUSIONS: RARC with ICUD achieved peroperative outcomes and complication 
rates comparable than those with ECUD. The ICUD could reduce the risk of 
developing uretero-ileal and urethro-neobladder strictures.

INTRODUCTION: We present the short-term voiding patterns and functional and 
urodynamic outcomes of W-shaped ileal orthotopic neobladder (ONB) following 
radical cystectomy (RC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients who underwent RC and W-shaped ONB 
creation between July 2015 and January 2018 were enrolled. Data were analyzed in 
terms of voiding patterns, urodynamic findings, and functional outcomes at 6 
months after surgery. Pouch-related quality of life (QoL) was assessed using 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Generic (QLQ 
C30), Bladder Cancer-Specific Instruments (QLQ BM30), and IONB-Patient-Reported 
Outcome (IONB-PRO).
RESULTS: The mean length of follow-up was 19.4 months. At first follow-up, three 
patients had developed acidosis and rising serum creatinine, and one of them 
required temporary hemodialysis. One patient developed urethral-pouch 
anastomotic stricture, which required bladder neck incision. Balloon dilatation 
was performed for ureteroileal anastomotic stricture and mesh repair for 
incisional hernia was required in one patient each. Upper tract changes were 
observed in two patients. During the first and second follow-up, maximum flow 
rate, voided volume, and postvoid residual urine were 12 ± 4.7 mL/s, 212 ± 120 
mL, and 72 + 81 mL and 14.7 ± 5.3 mL/s, 254 ± 168 mL, and 123.7 ± 42.5 mL, 
respectively. The mean pouch capacity and compliance were 436 ± 103.5 mL and 
50.6 ± 17.8 mL/cm H2O. No patient required clean intermittent catheterization 
for bladder emptying. In EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the "Cognitive" domain had 
the highest and "global QoL" domain had the lowest level of functional scores. 
"Nausea and vomiting and abdominal bloating and flatulence" domain had the 
lowest level and "financial difficulties and urinary symptoms" had the highest 
level of symptomatology in EORTC QLQ questionnaire. The IONB-PRO questionnaire 
showed the highest level of functioning in "relation life" and the lowest level 
in "emotional life" domain.
CONCLUSION: The Ghoneim pouch has a low complication rate with near-normal 
voiding patterns with an acceptable QoL impairment.

Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal orthotopic 
neobladder (ONB) can be recognized to be the supreme discipline in urological 
pelvic surgery. The utilization of RARC with intracorporeal urinary diversion 
(ICUD) has increased during the last 15 years. This increase is primarily noted 
for ICUD with ileal conduits, but with a lesser extent also for IC neobladders, 
with an increase from 7% in 2005 to 17% in 2016. However, these observations are 
limited to a few centers of excellence reflecting the fact that IC ONB formation 
is regarded as technically challenging and time-consuming with a steep learning 
curve. The objective of this review is to summarize the current data about RARC 
with IC ileal ONB in terms of patient selection, preoperative preparation, 
functional outcomes, complications and oncological outcomes. Careful patient 
selection considering absolute and relative contraindications for RARC and/or 
ONB as well as the implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol 
is an integral part of successful oncological, functional and complication 
outcomes. Nerve sparing procedures in males and gynaecological organ sparing in 
females should be attempted in order to maximize functional outcomes. Different 
techniques of ICUD with ONB after RARC are described; however, all of them 
adhere to the principles for the functioning of an ONB. Both functional outcomes 
and complication rates have been improved significantly during the last few 
years. The current evidence for long-term outcomes following RARC shows 
acceptable oncological outcomes comparable to an open series including 
recurrence-free survival data, positive surgical margin rates and median pelvic 
lymph node yields.

Objective: To optimize the surgical procedures of laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy and urinary diversion for the elderly patients with bladder cancer, 
generalize operating technique, summarize clinical experiences. Methods: From 
July 2004 to October 2016, laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) and urinary 
diversion was performed in 68 elderly patients (≥75 years old) diagnosed with 
bladder cancer in urology department of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital 
Medical University, and the relevant clinical and follow-up data were 
retrospectively reviewed. All the patients were pathologically diagnosed and 
their perioperative data, postoperative pathological results, postoperative 
complications and follow-up outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among 
68 elderly patients with bladder cancer, fifty patients were male and 18 were 
female, the age of whom were (79±4) (range 75 to 91) years old. The Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI) score was 6±1 (range 5 to 7). All the 68 operations were 
successfully performed without conversion to open surgery. There were 26 cases 
receiving cutaneous ureterostomy, 34 cases receiving ileal conduit 
(intracorporeal for 16 cases and extracorporeal for 18 cases) and 8 cases 
receiving orthotopic ileal neobladder (intracorporeal for 4 cases and 
extracorporeal for 4 cases; Xing's technique for 4 cases, T-Pouch for 2 cases 
and Studer-Pouch for 2 cases) respectively, and the operation time of these 
three groups were (221±47) min, (315±70) min and (358±90) min respectively, the 
estimated blood loss were 100 (87, 200)ml, 300 (250, 500) ml and 250 (113, 725) 
ml respectively, the time of intake of liquid diet were 3 (2, 4) d, 6 (5, 7) d 
and 9 (5, 12) d respectively, and the postoperative hospital stay were (12±6) d, 
(24±11) d, and (27±11) d respectively. Postoperative pathological results showed 
urothelial carcinoma in 64 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in 2 patients and 
adenocarcinoma in 2 patients. Sixty patients received laparoscopic pelvic 
lymphadenectomy and the number of dissected lymph nodes was 17.1±7.0. There were 
46 cases with T stage greater than or equal to T2 (46/68, 67.6%), 4 cases of low 
grade (4/68, 5.9%) and 60 cases of high grade (60/68, 88.2%). All the early 
postoperative (within 30 days after the operation) complications were grade Ⅰ-Ⅱ 
mainly manifested as fever, pain and infection that could get better with 
symptomatic treatment, and the incidence rate were 30.8% for cutaneous 
ureterostomy, 29.4% for ileal conduit and 37.5% for orthotopic ileal neobladder. 
The patients were followed up for a median period of 93.5 months without obvious 
hydronephrosis and impaired renal function. The 5-year cancer specific survival 
rate and overall survival rate were 57% and 50% respectively. There was 
significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative QOL (quality 
of life) score (56.0±10.0 and 47.4±5.8 respectively, P<0.05) which indicated 
that the patients' postoperative quality of life was greatly improved. 
Conclusions: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for the 
elderly patients with bladder cancer is safe and feasible, and owns great 
therapeutic value.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer in women is an indication for radical cystectomy (RC) 
when the tumour is confined muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) of T2 N0M0, or 
high risk progressive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Radical 
cystectomy is either genital-sparing cystectomy (GSC) or standard 
urethra-sparing cystectomy (USC) that is followed with orthotopic ileal 
neobladder (ONB). Post-operative chronic retention "Hypercontinence" had been 
reported in different series following URS or GSC and ONB. In long-term 
follow-up, we evaluated the functional outcome of women who developed 
hypercontinence after USC or GSC and ONB.
AIM: An ultrastructure study of female urethral smooth muscle was done to 
elucidate the underlying causes of hypercontinence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study was conducted on 71 women who 
underwent RC and ONB, 45women had undergone USC, and 26 women had GSC, follow-up 
ranged from 5 to 15 years. Ultrastructure studies were done on 5 urethral biopsy 
specimens from 5 women who had hypercontinence, and 4 biopsies were from a 
normal control.
RESULTS: Follow-up showed that women who had undergone USC and ONB, 28.88% 
developed hypercontinence, where in the series of GSC and ONB three women out of 
26 developed hypercontinence (7.80%). Three women who had hypercontinence 
following USC and ONB, they developed stones in the ileal pouch. Ultrastructure 
study of urethral smooth muscles in women who had hypercontinence showed 
organized collagen fibrils, absent myelin sheath, and non-detected lymphatic 
vessels. Normal urethra showed collagen fibrils within the interstitial matrix, 
preserved myelin sheath of nerve fibres, the presence of lymphatic vessels in 
the matrix.
CONCLUSION: The present study shoes that GSC with ONB leads to the minimal 
incidence of hypercontinence (7.80%), while standard USC lead to higher 
incidence (28.88%). Ultrastructure changes of the female urethra who had 
hypercontinence were fibrotic changes, loss of myelin sheath and minimal 
vascularity, their findings explains the underlying cause of hypercontinence and 
support the technique of GSC rather than the standard USC.

There has been growing  interest in intracorporeal techniques to urinary 
diversion during cystectomy in the modern area. There is little high-quality 
evidence that this technique is superior to  extracorporeal diversion in 
patients who are obtaining  an orthotopic intracorporeal neobladder urinary 
diversion. This study describes the proposed advantages and  disadvantages of 
intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion and expert opinion on 
preference.  METHODS: We reviewed the literature for all studies  discussing the 
outcomes and advantages of intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder urinary 
diversion, including those comparing the intracorporeal and 
extracorporeal approach. The studies were reviewed and these findings were 
summarized based on categories of the proposed advantages and disadvantages of 
the intracorporeal approach. We provided an assessment of the claims made in 
favor of the intracorporeal approach and discussed advantages of the 
extracorporeal approach that may persuade even the most experienced robotic 
surgeons to lean away from the former.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Herein we 
review the studies that propose advantages of the intracorporeal diversion, as 
well as the studies that do not demonstrate any advantage to this approach. Some 
of the proposedadvantages addressed include decreased stricture rate, lower 
complications and shorter hospitalization. Furthermore, we address the issues of 
the steep learningcurve and the impact on resident education. We conclude that 
the proposed benefits of an intracorporeal approach to urinary diversion are not 
substantiated and it is the preference of the authors to primarily perform 
extracorporeal urinary diversions.

OBJECTIVE: It is well known that RARC with intracorporeal diversion is being 
increasingly performed worldwide. In this article, we review the current 
situation of the intracorporeal neobladder.
METHODS: We discuss the principles of intracorporeal orhotopic diversion, 
focusing on the most relevant: The Karolinska-modified Studer neobladder, the 
University of Southern California-modified Studer neobladder. The pyramid pouch 
and the modified Y-shaped orthotopic neobladder. We also compare functional and 
perioperative outcomes from our series and the available studies regarding RARC 
and intracorporeal orthotopic diversion. RESULTS: Review of existing literature 
suggests that RARC with totally intracorporeal neobladder, in some cases, has 
improved operative,  postoperative, and functional outcomes, becoming a safe and 
feasible alternative to ORC.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from the intraorporeal neobladders series appear to be 
promising, but high-quality randomized controlled trials comparing to ICUD 
to ECUD should be performed in order to define the advantages and  disadvantages 
of totally intracorporeal urinary diversion and its future role in the treatment 
of invasive bladder cancer.

Pubic bone osteomyelitis is a rare infectious condition which is characterized 
by a complex diagnostic and therapeutic workup, due to its various clinical 
manifestations. Among the many causes of this condition, urinary fistula is the 
most common in case of previous urological procedures. In order to solve this 
complication, it is crucial to treat both the fistula and (moreover) the 
infectious locus arising from it, because treating the fistula alone does not 
provide any control on the infectious noxa. We present the first case of pubic 
bone osteomyelitis arising from a urinary fistula after a robotic radical 
cystectomy with intra corporeal continent neobladder, which has been 
successfully treated through a multidisciplinary approach.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to describe the use of posterior 
muscle-fascial reconstruction during urethro-ileal anastomosis in bladder cancer 
(BC) patients submitted to robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RC) with 
orthotopic neobladder (ON) and its role in facilitating day- and night-time 
continence recovery during a 12-month follow up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data from 42 consecutive 
patients who underwent RARC with totally intracorporeal ON and extended pelvic 
lymph node dissection (PLND) at our Institution from June 2014 to October 2017. 
Prior to the urethro-neobladder anastomosis we reconstructed the Denonvilliers 
Fascia (DF) as previously described for radical prostatectomy using a 
bidirectional barbed suture. Day and night-time recovery rates were reported at 
3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, with continent patients being those using 
either no urinary pads or 1 safety pads.
RESULTS: Median age at surgery was 63 yrs, 41 (97.6%) patients were male. 28 
(66.7%) patients presented a clinical T2 disease. Median operative time and 
median ON reconstruction time were 450 minutes and 180 minutes respectively. 13 
(31%) individuals had non-organ confined disease, with 11 (26.2%) patients with 
positive lymph nodes (median 3 positive lymph nodes) and 2 (4.8%) with 
non-urothelial cancer at final pathologic examination. Median hospital stay and 
median catheterization time were 7 (IQR 7-8) and 21 (IQR 19-22). During first 30 
post-operative days we recorded 7 (16.7%) low-grade Clavien and 2 (4.8%) IIIa 
Clavien complications, whereas between 30 and 90 postoperative days we recorded 
4 (9.5%) low-grade, 4 (9.5) IIIa and 1 (2.4%) IIIb complications. Day-time and 
night-time continence rates were 61.9% vs 52.4%, 73.8% vs 64.3% and 90.5% vs 
73.8% at three, six and twelve months follow up. Day-time continence was 
significantly superior in the younger group (97% vs 57%, p 0.01); night-time 
continence rates were also superior among < 70 yrs patients, despite not 
reaching statistical significance (77% vs 57%, p 0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior muscle-fascial reconstruction aids continence recovery in 
BC patients undergoing RARC with ON, with younger and fitter patients most 
benefitting from ON reconstruction.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation (DLBCL-CI), 
specifically arising in ileal neobladder, is a rare neoplasm. We present an 
unusual case of Epstein- Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL-CI arising within 
neobladder with detailed clinical, histological, and immunophenotypical features 
in an immunocompetent patient. An 88-year-old male was admitted for gross 
hematuria. He had undergone radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder 17 years ago 
for invasive bladder cancer. Computed tomography showed enhancing lesions on 
dome and posterior wall of neobladder with mucosal thickening and multiple 
enlarged retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies. Transurethralresection of neobladder 
lesion revealed the diffuse infiltration of large lymphoid cells which were 
positive for CD20, CD30, and multiple myeloma oncogen-1 with EBV-encoded small 
RNAs co-localizing, and diagnosis of EBV-positive DLBCL-CI was made. After 
multi-agent chemotherapy, the lesion disappeared. We suggest that clinicians 
should consider the possibility of DLBCL-CI in patients presented with hematuria 
during follow-up after bladder reconstruction.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To report the initial experience and the early outcomes of 
a modified U-shaped ileal neobladder, which was developed to facilitate the 
neobladder-urethral anastomosis by minimizing the anastomotic tension.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2015 and December 2016, two male and two 
female patients (median age: 65.5 years, range: 43-72 years) underwent the 
modified U-shaped ileal neobladder after robotic-assisted radical cystectomy 
(RARC). The most mobile and dependent ileal segment was first selected 
intracorporeally as the site for later neobladder-urethral anastomosis. The 
neobladder was formed extracorporeally, and the previously selected ileal 
segment formed the most dependent portion of the neobladder. The 
neobladder-urethral anastomosis was completed after robotic redocking.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 8 months (3-21 months). The median operative 
time, console time, and extracorporeal reconstruction time were 620 min (534-674 
min), 372 min (314-420 min), and 151 min (128-215 min), respectively. In all 
patients, the neobladder-urethral anastomosis was completed intracorporeally 
with minimal tension. The median hospital time after the surgery was 14.5 days 
(14-19 days). Postoperatively, the median peak flow rate and void volume were 10 
ml/s (4-35 ml/s) and 258 ml (88-775 ml). The median postvoid residual was 20 ml 
(10-53 ml). At daytime, two were completely continent; the other two reported 
mild (1-2 pads) and moderate (>2 pads) incontinence at the postoperative 3 and 4 
months, respectively. Three reported nocturnal enuresis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience demonstrated that the modified U-shaped 
neobladder designed for minimizing the anastomotic tension is safe and feasible 
with its satisfactory functional outcomes.

Introduction: There is paucity of literature about the validation of the 
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS 
NSQIP®) surgical risk calculator for prediction of outcomes after robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC). We sought to evaluate the accuracy of the ACS NSQIP 
surgical risk calculator in the patients who underwent RARC at our institute. 
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained database for 
patients who underwent RARC between 2005 and 2017. Accuracy of the ACS NSQIP 
surgical risk calculator was assessed, by comparing the rate of actual 
complication events after surgery with the receiver operating characteristics 
curve analysis by calculating the fractional area under the curve (AUC) and the 
Brier score (BS). We utilized the code number 51595 and 51596 in the ACS NSQIP 
calculator for the patients undergoing radical cystectomy and reconstructed with 
the ileal conduit and neobladder, respectively. Results: A total of 462 patients 
were included in this study: 99 (22%) had diabetes, 302 (66%) had hypertension 
requiring medication, and 241 (52%) were classified as high American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (≥3) class. The actual observed rates of any complication and 
serious complications were 48% and 11%, vs 29% and 25% predicted by the ACS 
NSQIP, respectively. The actual mean length of hospital stay (10.6 ± 7.8 days) 
was longer compared with the predicted length (8.5 ± 1.6 days). AUC values were 
low and the BSs were high for any complication (AUC: 0.50 and BS: 0.29), serious 
complication (AUC: 0.53 and BS: 0.12), urinary tract infection (AUC: 0.61 and 
BS: 0.14), renal insufficiency (AUC: 0.64 and BS: 0.08), return to operation 
room (AUC: 0.58 and BS: 0.07), and early readmission (AUC: 0.55 and BS: 0.11, 
respectively). Conclusions: The ACS NSQIP calculator demonstrated low accuracy 
in predicting postoperative outcomes after RARC. These findings highlight the 
need for development of procedure- and technique-specific RARC calculators.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion affect various 
dimensions of patents' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Knowledge 
regarding patient-reported HRQOL following RC is mainly based on retrospective 
findings of cross-sectional studies.
OBJECTIVE: To provide data from a large prospective propensity score-matched 
cohort with a systematic follow-up of up to 2 yr.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 134 consecutive patients who 
underwent RC and ileal conduit (IC) or orthotopic ileal neobladder (ONB) urinary 
diversion in a tertiary care centre were prospectively enrolled, and a 
propensity score matching analysis based on American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score, age, and tumour stage was performed. Exclusion criteria 
encompassed age <30 yr and RC due to benign diseases. HRQOL was addressed with 
the validated European Organization for Research and TREATMENT: of Cancer 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire. HRQOL was assessed preoperatively, and at 3, 12, and 24 
mo postoperatively. Of the nondeceased patients, 85.1% (IC) and 78.2% (ONB) 
completed the study.
INTERVENTION: RC.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was good 
general HRQOL based on previously published cut-off values. Secondary endpoints 
encompassed the respective HRQOL domains. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
were performed using binary logistic regression models.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the longitudinal analysis of RC patients, 
functioning and symptoms scores show a similar natural HRQOL course for IC and 
ONB patients. After 24 mo, general HRQOL was significantly higher in the ONB 
subcohort (60.5 vs 73.6, p=0.013). Good general HRQOL was reached by 32.4 (IC) 
versus 61.1% (ONB; p=0.019). In the multivariable analysis, ONB was not an 
independent predictor of good HRQOL (odds ratio 2.211, 95% confidence interval 
0.684-7.150, p=0.185). Limitations include the nonbladder specificity of the 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the small sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides prospective data from a unique 
propensity score-matched contemporary patient cohort. We display the natural 
history of general HRQOL and its subdomains without observing significantly 
higher midterm postoperative HRQOL in patients undergoing continent urinary 
diversion in the multivariable analysis.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We analyse the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of 
European patients who underwent radical cystectomy due to bladder cancer and 
found that HRQOL was slightly better for orthotopic ileal neobladder than for 
ileal conduit urinary diversion after 24 mo.

PURPOSE: Patient centered care aims to align treatment with patient goals, 
especially when treatment options have equivalent clinical outcomes. For 
surgeries with lasting impacts that alignment is critical. To our knowledge no 
psychometrically tested preference elicitation measures exist to support 
patients with bladder cancer treated with cystectomy, who can often choose 
between ileal conduit and neobladder diversions. In this study we created a 
scale to measure how patient goals align with each type of urinary diversion and 
the associated surgical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed formative research through focus groups and 
clinician outreach to adapt a goal dissonance measure. We mailed a survey to 
adult Kaiser Permanente® members who underwent cystectomy for bladder cancer 
between January 2013 and June 2015. Eligible patients were identified through 
electronic health records and chart review. Surveys were mailed 5 to 7 months 
postoperatively. We administered our 10-item decision dissonance scale along 
with other decision making measures. We explored goal alignment as well as 
dissonance. Psychometric analysis included factor analysis, evaluation of scale 
scores between surgery groups and evaluation with other decision making scores.
RESULTS: We identified 10 goals associated with ileal conduit or neobladder 
diversion. Using survey data on 215 patients our scale differentiated patient 
goals associated with each diversion choice. On average patients with a 
neobladder strongly valued neobladder aligned goals such as maintaining body 
integrity and volitional voiding through the urethra. Patients with an ileal 
conduit had neutral values on average across all goals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our measure lays the foundation for a simple value elicitation 
approach which could facilitate shared decision making about urinary diversion 
choice.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review historical aspects and current status of the 
emerging approach of robotic urinary diversion (rUD). Established surgical 
principles of constructing a low-pressure, large-capacity reservoir are 
described and the open surgical literature succinctly reviewed to establish the 
gold standard. Incontinent and continent rUD types [ileal conduit, orthotopic 
neobladder (all varieties), continent cutaneous diversion, cutaneous 
ureterostomy] and techniques (extra-corporeal, intra-corporeal) are discussed. 
Outcomes data (intra-operative, perioperative, intermediate-term, long-term), 
functional outcomes, complications and learning curve are presented. Outcomes 
data of open versus robotic urinary diversion are examined. Critiques, 
improvements, and pros-cons of rUD are discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although the majority of centers performing rUD use the 
extracorporeal technique, use of intra-corporeal rUD is increasing. Although 
data are yet limited, intra-corporeal rUD may provide some benefits. For rUD, 
operative times are higher and complication rates comparable with open urinary 
diversion.
SUMMARY: The entire range of urinary diversion surgery has now been replicated 
robotically. At this writing, extracorporeal urinary diversion techniques still 
predominate following robotic cystectomy. However, all rUD options can now be 
performed intra-corporeally with success. As experience increases, the field of 
robotic urinary diversion is poised to grow.

Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

PURPOSE: to evaluate the 30-day death rate and the factors associated with 
short-term complications after radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive urothelial 
bladder cancer.
METHODS: The study included 123 patients (age 64.1±7.9 years; 111 (90.2%) males 
and 12 (9.8%) females) previously diagnosed with urothelial bladder cancer, 
admitted for radical cystectomy in a tertiary center. The following data were 
noted: age, gender, perioperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, pre- and 
postoperative hemoglobin and creatinine levels, tumor stage, type of surgery, 
type of diversion and Clavien classification. Patients were followed for 30 days 
and several complications were noted: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, local, 
or infectious complications, anemia. Death rate was also recorded.
RESULTS: Open cystectomy was performed in 81 (65.9%) patients, and laparoscopic 
approach was used in 43 (34.1%) patients. An ileal neobladder was created for 11 
(8.9%) patients and noncontinent diversion for 112 (91.1%). There were 2 (1.6%) 
deaths following surgery. The following complication rates were noted: 27 local 
(22%), 16 infectious (13%), 54 cases of postoperative anemia (43.9%). 
Postoperative anemia was independently associated with open cystectomy (OR, 5.7; 
p=0.001), ileal neobladder (Odds ratio/OR, 14.6, p=0.002) and male gender (OR, 
0.15, p=0.01). The Clavien classification did not differ between open and 
laparoscopic cystectomy (p=0.3), even though the complication grade was higher 
in the former.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day death rate after radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive 
urothelial bladder cancer was low. Open cystectomy was associated with more 
severe short-term complications as compared with the laparoscopic approach. 
Postoperative anemia was associated with the type of surgery, diversion type and 
male gender.

PURPOSE: To objectively quantify continence rates and to correlate continence 
outcomes with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after radical cystectomy 
and orthotopic ileal neobladder (ONB).
METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 244 patients who underwent radical 
cystectomy with ONB between 2004 and 2015, and information about the current 
continence status was retrieved. To objectify postoperative urine loss, daytime 
and nocturnal pad tests were performed. Continence was defined as need of up to 
one safety pad. HRQOL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring with global 
health status being the primary endpoint. Statistical analysis included Fisher's 
test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's rank correlation, and binary regression 
models (p < 0.05).
RESULTS: 178 patients (73.0%) answered the QLQ-C30 questionnaires and were 
included in the study. Median follow-up was 61 months. Median daytime pad use 
was 1 and median daily urine loss based on pad testing was 4.0 g, leading to a 
daytime continence rate of 48.5%. Continence had a significant impact on 
postoperative HRQOL (p = 0.017). ICIQ-SF score (p = 0.001, OR = 0.805) and need 
for condom catheter during nighttime (p = 0.015, OR = 0.123) were independent 
predictors for worse HRQOL outcomes based on global health status. A history of 
pelvic floor muscle training was an independent predictor of increased HRQOL 
(p = 0.009, OR = 10.459).
CONCLUSIONS: Need of condom urinals and higher ICIQ-SF scores are independent 
predictors for worse HRQOL outcomes. We show significant beneficial effects of 
pelvic floor muscle training on patients' HRQOL.

PURPOSE: Patients who undergo radical cystectomy of bladder cancer are at high 
risk for complications and hospital readmissions. Studies indicate insufficient 
preoperative education and perioperative monitoring. The aim of this study was 
to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a health care application to 
provide more patient education and more thorough monitoring perioperatively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants with home Wi-Fi access who were undergoing 
radical cystectomy were recruited for this pilot trial. Each subject was 
provided a tablet preloaded with the m.Care (LifeScience Technologies, Leawood, 
Kansas) health care application, an accelerometer and vital sign equipment. 
Participants were asked to watch educational videos, use the provided 
accelerometer and perform vital sign monitoring.
RESULTS: In 1 year 20 participants enrolled in the study and 15 completed it. 
The most frequently viewed videos were "Ileal Conduit versus Neobladder" and 
"Comprehensive Care Pathway." All participants used the accelerometer and 60% 
kept up with syncing the data regularly. The average step count preoperatively 
was 5,679 reflecting a sedentary population. Step counts decreased during the 
inpatient stay (1,351 steps) and trended toward baseline during the 
postoperative period (3,156 steps). Vital signs were recorded on 85% of assigned 
days and generated 33 triggers for intervention. While most triggers led to 
repeat assessment, education and encouragement, 4 participants underwent 
outpatient treatment, including cultures, intravenous fluids, antibiotics or 
dronabinol prescription, without the need for hospital readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing more education and monitoring perioperatively is feasible 
using a health care application. Testing is warranted to determine the extent to 
which implementation will improve patient triaging and reduce readmissions.

Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer. Robot-assisted radical cystectomy has technical advantages over 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy and has emerged as an alternative to open 
radical cystectomy. Despite the advancements in robotic surgery, experience with 
total intracorporeal reconstruction of urinary diversion remains limited. Most 
surgeons have carried out the hybrid approach of robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy and extracorporeal reconstruction of urinary diversion, as 
intracorporeal reconstruction of urinary diversion remains technically 
challenging. However, intracorporeal reconstruction of urinary diversion might 
potentially proffer additional benefits, such as decreased fluid loss, reduction 
in estimated blood loss and a quicker return of bowel function. The adoption of 
intracorporeal ileal neobladder reconstruction has hitherto been limited to 
high-volume academic institutions. In the present review, we compare the totally 
intracorporeal robot-assisted radical cystectomy approach with open radical 
cystectomy and robot-assisted radical cystectomy + extracorporeal reconstruction 
of urinary diversion in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of radical cystectomy and orthotopic 
neobladder (NB) diversion on device-related outcomes in patients who undergo 
subsequent placement of both, an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) and 3-piece 
inflatable penile prosthesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an institutional prosthetic database, we identified 
39 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and NB and subsequent implantation 
of both prosthetic devices from 2003 to 2017. Patient demographics, 
perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes including prosthetic infection, 
mechanical failure, revision surgery, and functional outcomes were examined and 
compared to an appropriate matched group of patients (n = 48, non-neobladder 
group).
RESULTS: No intraoperative complications were observed. After median follow-up 
of 94 months (12-177 months), 1 patient developed an infection of their penile 
prosthesis and 4 patients developed an erosion of their AUS. In each case, the 
infection did not involve the other device. Two patients required revision 
surgery of their penile prosthesis due to mechanical failure (reservoir leak, 
n = 1; cylinder aneurysm, n = 1). Twenty-one patients underwent elective 
revision surgery to improve continence (cuff downsizing, n = 18; 
pressure-regulating balloon exchange, n = 3). There were 6 cases of AUS 
mechanical failure. No reservoir-related complications such as herniation or 
erosion were observed. Compared to the control group of non-neobladder patients, 
there were no significant differences in prosthetic infection, mechanical 
failure, and revision surgery.
CONCLUSION: The AUS and 3-piece inflatable penile prosthesis can coexist safely 
in patients with NB without an increased risk of device-related complications.

OBJECTIVES: To determine and investigate the intraoperative factors that 
contribute to a change in plan from continent orthotopic neobladder to ileal 
conduit or continent cutaneous diversion at the time of radical cystectomy.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained 
bladder cancer database was performed. Of the 711 patients who underwent radical 
cystectomy from 2012 to 2016, 387 (54.4%) had given consent to have a NB. Of 
these 387 patients, 348 (89.9%) ultimately received a neobladder while 34 (8.8%) 
received an ileal conduit and 5 (1.3%) continent cutaneous diversion. The 
factors involved in the intraoperative change of plan were examined in this 
study.
RESULTS: Patients who ultimately received a neobladder were significantly more 
likely to have clinical node-negative disease (p = 0.045), negative soft tissue 
margins (p = 0.001), lower body mass index (p = 0.045) and higher volume 
surgeons (p < 0.001). Oncologic reasons for intraoperative conversions were more 
common than technical reasons (58.3% vs 35.9%), in both robotic and open 
surgical techniques. The choice of surgical approach (open vs robotic) did not 
influence the rate of intraoperative conversion.
CONCLUSION: The factors influencing intraoperative decision not to perform 
neobladder are predominantly oncologic rather than technical. A clear 
understanding of the factors involved in influencing the intraoperative change 
in the urinary diversion plan may improve shared decision making in patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy in the future.

Radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary diversion (UD) is still the standard 
treatment method for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Type of UD is determined 
according to some characteristics of the patient and the tumor. Even in the most 
experienced hands, alternative scenarios may require an alternative diversion, 
including emergency UD for complications requiring immediate take down of the 
initial UD, tumor recurrence impacting the urinary tract or the UD, progressive 
impairment of renal function (in patients with a continent UD), 
malfunction/complications of the initial UD, and patient dislike of a stoma. We 
report a case of undiversion with natural history and outcome in a patient who 
had previously undergone RC and ileal conduit performed.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the step-by-step techniques for robot-assisted ureteric 
reimplantation performed using the Vinci SP® surgical system (Intuitive 
Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), including different case scenarios with an 
educational purpose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three consecutive patients diagnosed with distal benign 
ureteric strictures were counselled for ureteric reimplantation and consented to 
undergo surgery performed using the da Vinci SP surgical system. Demographics 
and peri-operative outcomes were collected after institutional review board 
approval (IRB 13-780). Patients provided informed consent having received an 
explanation for the adoption of the novel platform. The first patient was a 
woman referred to our institution for a left distal ureteric stricture after 
total hysterectomy for uterine fibroids with ureteric injury. The second patient 
was a man with BPH and recurrent UTIs, who was diagnosed with a 1.5-cm bladder 
stone and a large bladder diverticulum compressing the left distal ureter. The 
third patient was a man diagnosed with bilateral uretero-enteric anastomoses 
stricture status after radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder 
urinary diversion for bladder cancer.
RESULTS: The procedures were successfully completed. An extra port through a 
separate skin incision for the bedside assistant was placed for the first two 
procedures. In such cases, this additional port was used electively from the 
start of the procedure and did not represent a change in the treatment plan. 
Moreover, the port wound was used to accommodate the drainage. The bilateral 
ureteric reimplantation, however, was completed according to a pure single-site 
approach (no extra ports were placed out of the GelSeal cap). The mean operating 
times were 165, 150 and 180 min, respectively. Blood loss was 50 mL in all 
cases. No intra-operative complications occurred. Patients were discharged on 
postoperative days 1, 1 and 2, respectively, with normal serum creatinine 
levels. Neither transfusions nor major complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted reconstructive surgery for benign distal ureteric 
strictures is feasible and safe using the da Vinci SP surgical system.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed recent trends in both urinary diversion after radical 
cystectomy for bladder cancer in the United States and patient- and 
hospital-related characteristics. We also identified variables associated with 
undergoing continent diversion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried the National Cancer Database and identified 
27,170 patients who underwent radical cystectomy with urinary diversion from 
2004 to 2013. Patient demographics, socioeconomic variables, and 
hospital-related factors were compared between incontinent and continent 
diversion and trended over time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to 
identify variables associated with undergoing continent diversion.
RESULTS: Overall, 23,224 (85.5%) and 3,946 (14.5%) patients underwent 
incontinent and continent diversion, respectively. Continent diversion declined 
from 17.2% in 2004 to 2006 to 12.1% in 2010 to 2013 (P < 0.01). When analyzing 
high-volume facilities, those performing ≥75% minimally invasive radical 
cystectomy had fewer continent diversions (10.2%) compared to centers with 
higher rate of open approach (19.7%), P < 0.01. Higher income, facility located 
in the West, academic programs, high-volume facilities, and patients traveling 
>60 miles for care were significantly associated with undergoing continent 
diversion. Rate of continent diversion has declined in most patient- and 
hospital-related subgroups. Compared to 2004 to 2006, patients in 2010 to 2013 
were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and be operated on at a 
high-volume academic facility.
CONCLUSION: The rate of continent diversion has declined to 12.1% in the United 
States. Hospital volume and type, patient income, distance traveled for care, 
and geography are significantly associated with undergoing continent diversion. 
Even among high-volume and academic centers, the rate of continent diversion is 
declining.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative contributions of patient and surgeon factors 
for predicting selection of ileal conduit (IC), neobladder (NB), or continent 
pouch (CP) urinary diversions (UD) for patients diagnosed with 
muscle-invasive/high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. This information is 
needed to enhance research comparing cancer survivors' outcomes across different 
surgical treatment options.
METHODS: Bladder cancer patients' age ≥21 years with cystectomy/UD performed 
from January 2010 to June 2015 in 3 Kaiser Permanente regions were included. All 
patient and surgeon data were obtained from electronic health records. A mixed 
effects logistic regression model was used treating surgeon as a random effect 
and region as a fixed effect.
RESULTS: Of 991 eligible patients, 794 (80%) received IC. One hundred sixty-nine 
surgeons performed the surgeries and accounted for a sizeable proportion of the 
variability in patient receipt of UD (intraclass correlation 
coefficient = 0.26). The multilevel model with only patient factors showed good 
fit (area under the curve = 0.93, Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = .44), and older age, 
female sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate <45, 4+ comorbidity index 
score, and stage III/IV tumors were associated with higher odds of receiving an 
IC vs neobladder/continent pouch. However, including surgeon factors (annual 
cystectomy volume, specialty training, clinical tenure) had no association 
(P = .29).
CONCLUSION: In this community setting, patient factors were major predictors of 
UD received. Surgeons also played a substantial role, yet clinical training and 
experience were not major predictors. Surgeon factors such as beliefs about UD 
options and outcomes should be explored.

OBJECTIVE: To illustrate our technique to construct the Institute of Urology 
Peking University (IUPU) orthotopic ileal bladder and present our initial 
experience.
METHODS: From August 2017 to April 2018, 12 patients with bladder cancer 
underwent radical cystectomy (RC), pelvic lymph node dissection and 
extracorporeal construction of an IUPU neobladder (IUPUB) by an experienced 
surgeon. We present the demographic, clinicopathologic, perioperative, and 
follow-up data. We also describe our step-by-step surgical technique for the 
IUPUB in this article.
RESULTS: Laparoscopic RC with an extracorporeal IUPUB was successfully 
accomplished in 11 patients, and 1 patient was converted to open RC with an 
IUPUB. The median total operative time and median time spent suturing the pouch 
were 248 minutes and 23 minutes, respectively. The median estimated blood loss 
was 150 mL. The median time to recovery of bowel function (tolerance of a liquid 
diet) was 3½ days. The urinary catheter was removed on post-operative day 21 in 
10 patients. The ureteral stents and stoma catheter were removed on day 7 after 
cystography. At a median followup of 7½ months, 2 patients had early 
complications (<30 days), and no major complications (grade ≥ 3) occurred. The 
follow-up outcomes were satisfactory. The limitations included the small sample 
size and short-term outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our technique of constructing the IUPUB is feasible and safe. The 
operative time and early complication rates are acceptable.

A profound number of prophylactic antibiotics are used after radical cystectomy 
with an ileal orthotopic neobladder (RCIONB) despite a negative effect of 
infection control. We investigated the impact of short-term prophylactic 
antibiotic use on infectious complications after RCIONB.We retrospectively 
reviewed data from 287 patients who underwent RCIONB for bladder cancer between 
2012 and 2016 at a tertiary hospital. The patients were divided into 2 groups 
according to the pattern of prophylactic antibiotics (185 patients in a 
long-term group, 25-day use of 3-staged multiple antibiotics versus 102 patients 
in a short-term group, 24-hour use of cefotetan). The onset of complications, 
including bacteriuria, febrile urinary tract infection (FU), and bacteremia, and 
the microorganisms responsible for infections were compared between the groups. 
Of all 287 patients, bacteriuria, FU, and bacteremia were identified in 177 
(61.7%), 85 (29.6%), and 18 (6.3%) patients, respectively. Bacteriuria was 
identified more frequently in the short-term group (49.2% vs 84.3%, P <.001). 
However, the rates of FU within 60 days of surgery were similar in both groups 
(28.6% vs 28.4%, P = .969). The rate of FU was not significantly different 
between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the rate of 
patients with bacteremia (5.4% vs 7.8%, P = .415). The most frequent 
microorganisms seen in bacteriuria were Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus 
faecalis, in the long-term and short-term group, respectively. 
Antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus species were more frequently present in the 
long-term group.Short-term use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for 
preventing urinary tract infections after RCIONB and decreasing colonization 
with multi-drug-resistant organisms.

INTRODUCTION: Women undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) followed by urinary 
diversion (UD) for bladder cancer experience a substantial reduction in 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). At present, studies comparing long-term 
QOL outcomes for different UD methods, needed to inform evidence-based choices 
of bladder reconstruction for female patients, are sparse. Our objective was to 
compare two common UD methods in terms of their HRQOL outcomes in women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed HRQOL in 73 consecutive 
female bladder cancer patients having undergone orthotopic ileal neobladder 
(IONB, N = 24) or ileal conduit (IC, N = 49) following RC between 2007 and 2013 
in six Italian academic urological centres. Patients had no evidence of tumour 
recurrence and were actively followed up. Validated Italian versions of the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) generic 
(QLQ-C30) and bladder-cancer-specific (QLQ-BLM30) questionnaires were used to 
evaluate HRQOL.
RESULTS: Patients in the IONB group were significantly younger than those in the 
IC group (median age: 67 and 73 years, respectively, p = 0.02). Barring that, 
the two groups did not present statistically significant differences in median 
length of follow-up (43 vs 54 months), pathological stage, grading of the 
neoplasm, or adjuvant chemo - or radiotherapy. No significant differences in QOL 
were found between the groups, with the exception of financial difficulties, 
affecting IONB patients significantly more than IC patients (mean score on a 
scale of 0-100: 33.3 ± 29.5 vs 18.4 ± 19.3, respectively; p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Financial difficulties was the only HRQOL item to differ between the 
two UD groups.

PURPOSE: The lower incidence of bladder cancer among women has led to a lack of 
information on female radical cystectomy (RC). This study aimed to analyze the 
characteristics related with female RC in a cohort from multiple academic 
institutions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 384 female patients 
who underwent RC for bladder cancer. Epidemiologic, perioperative variables 
including urologic referral periodwith consequent pathologic stage distributions 
were assessed. The changes in surgical techniques over time were illustrated. 
Also, we evaluated recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 2 and 5 years and overall 
survival (OS) at 5 years with stage-specific analyses using the Kaplan-Meier 
method.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 35 months (interquartile rage [IQR], 9 to 
55). The average time to urologic referral with initial symptoms was 5.5 (IQR, 1 
to 6) months and over 20% of patients visited clinics after 6 months. In 
subsequent stage distributions according to referral period, T2 or higher stage 
distributions were abruptly increased after 1 year. Overall 2-year/5-year RFS 
rates were 0.72/0.57 and 5-year OS was 0.61. Notable surgical descriptions were 
as follows: 91% of patients underwent open RC; 80% of patients underwent an 
ileal conduit; and 83% of patients received anterior exenteration. However, the 
proportions of robotic surgery, orthotopic neobladder and organ sparing 
cystectomy have increased recen-tly.
CONCLUSION: We identified the general characteristics and changes in pattern of 
female RC. Our results also suggest that women are susceptible to delays in 
referral to an urologist and are at greater risk for worse prognosis.

BACKGROUND: We describe a detailed novel step-by-step approach for creation of 
an ileal neobladder and compare the outcomes with standart neobladder.
METHODS: Between August 2009 and January 2016, 36 consecutive patients with 
bladder cancer underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion 
with an ileal neobladder. A novel technique of ileal neobladder construction, 
called the Anatolian neobladder, was designed by a single surgeon (ZT). 
Demographics and clinical data were collected. Perioperative, oncologic, and 
functional outcomes were reported. Complications were graded as early or late. 
These outcomes were compared with patients who underwent standard neobladder 
during this period in our center.
RESULTS: The operation was technically successful in all cases. Early 
postoperative complications occurred in 33.3% of the patients. Daytime 
continence was achieved successfully in 83.3% of the patients. No patient had 
severe metabolic acidosis. Six patients (16.6%) died during follow-up, five due 
to metastatic bladder cancer and one due to a cardiac problem. There was no any 
statistically significant difference between novel technique and standard 
neobladder for oncological and functional outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The Anatolian ileal neobladder is as feasible and safe as standard 
neobladder technique for urinary diversion in patients with bladder cancer 
undergoing radical cystectomy.

PURPOSE: To describe our technique and outcomes for laparoscopic intracorporeal 
ileal neobladder (ICNB) reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2014 to November 2016, 21 patients underwent 
laparoscopic ICNB at our tertiary referral centre. ICNB with bilateral 
isoperistaltic afferent limbs and several technique improvements were 
introduced. Demographics, clinical, and pathological data were collected. 
Perioperative, 1-year oncologic, 1-year Quality of life and 1-year functional 
outcomes were reported.
RESULTS: ICNB was successfully performed in all 21 patients without open 
conversion and transfusion. Mean operative time was 345.6±66.9 min, including 
106±22 min for LRC and PLND and 204±46.4 min for ICNB, respectively. Mean 
established blood loss was 192±146 mL. The overall incidence of 90-d 
complication was 33.3%, while major complication occurred in 4.8%. One-year 
daytime and night-time continence rates were 85.7% and 57.1%, respectively. One 
patient died from myocardial infarction six months postoperatively, and two 
patients had lung metastasis five months and six months respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We described our experience of 3D LRC with a novel intracorporeal 
orthotopic ileal neobladder, and the technique improvements facilitate the 
procedure. However, further studies are required to evaluate long-term outcomes 
of the intracorporeal neobladder with bilateral isoperistaltic afferent limbs.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate major complications and 
risk factors for adverse clinical outcome in surgical high-risk (American 
Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] 3-4) patients undergoing radical cystectomy 
(RC) in a high-volume setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1206 patients underwent RC between 2004 and 
2017 in our institution and were included. We assessed complications graded by 
the Clavien-Dindo-Classification system (CDC) in addition to the 90-day 
mortality rate and stratified results by the ASA classification. In a 
multivariate analysis, risk factors for high-grade complications (CDC ≥ 3) were 
tested. Additionally, outcome parameters were compared between 2004 to 2010 and 
2010 to 2017.
RESULTS: Patients with ASA ≥ 3 presented with more locally advanced tumors pT ≥ 
3 (52.1% vs. 42.4%; P = .002) and positive lymphatic spread N1 (27.2% vs. 23.5%; 
P = .001) compared with patients with ASA ≤ 2. High-grade complications were 
significantly (P < .001) more prevalent in patients with ASA ≥ 3 compared with 
patients with ASA ≤ 2: CDC3 (14.6% vs. 9.4%), CDC4 (10.2% vs. 5.4%), and CDC5 
(2.5% vs. 1.0%). The 90-day mortality rate (7.6% vs. 3.2%; P = .002) and 
perioperative reinterventions (23.5% vs. 13.1%; P < .001) were elevated in 
patients with ASA ≥ 3. ASA (odds ratio [OR], 2.701, 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.089-6.703; P = .032), previous abdominal operations (OR, 1.683; 95% CI, 
1.188-2.384; P = .003), and body mass index ≥ 30 (OR, 1.533; 95% CI, 
1.021-2.304; P = .039) proved to function as independent predictors for major 
complications. CDC ≥ 3 complications (31.7% vs. 24.3%; P = .029) and 90-day 
mortality (10.4% vs. 5.6%; P = .018) were significantly lower in the second half 
of the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and morbidity in surgical high-risk patients with ASA 3 
to 4 undergoing RC is about twice as high compared with patients with ASA 1 to 
2. ASA, previous abdominal operations, and elevated body mass index 
independently predict adverse clinical outcome in patients with ASA 3 to 4. Our 
results may help to weigh the surgical risk of RC in multimorbid patients.

OBJECTIVE: To compare quality of life (QoL) after urinary diversion (UD) 
following radical cystectomy (RC) using validated questionnaires.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2011 and June 2016, 150 patients (121 men 
[80.7%] and 29 women [19.3%]) with invasive bladder cancer who underwent RC and 
UD were included in this prospective study. Patients were divided into 2 groups; 
group I included the orthotopic neobladder 50 (33.3%) and uretro-sigmoidostomy 
41 (27.3%) and group II included uretero-cutanoustomy 33 (22.1%) and ileal 
conduit 26 (17.3%) patients. QOL was evaluated using the Functional Assessment 
of Cancer Therapy-Bladder Cancer. The erectile function (EF) was assessed using 
the Sexual Health Inventory for Men Questionnaire. Evaluation was done before 
and after one year postoperatively.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD patient age was 55.0 ± 7.9 and 59.5 ± 8.5 years in both 
groups, respectively (p = 0.001). There was a significant difference in the 
physical, social/family, emotional and functional statuses that were 
significantly higher in group I. One year postoperatively, the emotional 
well-being became insignificantly different, but other QoL parameters remained 
significantly different between both groups. Regarding EF, there was a 
significant difference between patients who underwent nerve-sparing (No. 29) and 
non nerve-sparing RC (No. 59) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Which type of diversion is the best is still a controversial topic. 
Egyptian patients may prefer the continent UD to avoid the urostomy appliance 
and its associated daily-life constraints. Detailed patient counseling and 
active participation of the patient in selecting the treatment methods are 
important for better postoperative QoL.

BACKGROUND: This study compared the surgical and urinary functional outcomes in 
patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who underwent robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) followed by intracorporeal ileal neobladder 
reconstruction (ICNB) to those in patients who underwent minimum incision 
endoscopic radical cystectomy (MIE-RC) followed by extracorporeal ileal 
neobladder reconstruction (ECNB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reviewed the clinical records of 153 
consecutive MIBC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by 
radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder reconstruction.
RESULTS: The operative time in the ICNB group was significantly longer than that 
in the ECNB group. The median estimated blood loss was significantly less in the 
ICNB group than in the ECNB group. The neobladder capacity gradually increased 
in both groups. The maximum neobladder pressure and urethral closure pressure 
gradually improved in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Our initial experience with ICNB was favourable, with acceptable 
surgical and urinary functional outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: We report on the surgical results of a series of 91 patients who 
received gastric neobladders as urinary diversion after radical cystectomies 
performed for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on a retrospective case series of 91 patients 
who received gastric neobladders as urinary diversion after radical cystectomies 
performed for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancers. Different 
techniques of gastric neobladders were employed from 1988 to 2013 at a 
university hospital in the South of Brazil.
RESULTS: Initial outcomes utilizing Leong (Antral) and Nguyen-Mitchell (Wedge) 
technique were unsatisfactory, yielding high pressure, low capacity reservoirs. 
Further developments of these techniques, with the detubularized gastric 
neobladder and the "spherical" gastric neobladders resulted in low pressure, 
high capacity reservoirs, with better surgical and urodynamic outcomes. 
Complication and perioperative mortality rates of our series of gastric 
neobladders were significantly higher than historical results of techniques 
using ileum or colon.
CONCLUSIONS: Stomach is an exceptional option for the creation of neobladders 
after radical cystectomies, but due to the increased complication rates it 
should be reserved for specific situations (e.g., renal insufficiency, previous 
pelvic/abdominal radiotherapy, short bowel syndromes).

INTRODUCTION: Entero-neovesical fistula is a rare complication after radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic ileal bladder substitution. Typical presenting 
symptoms are faecaluria, pneumaturia, recurrent urinary tract infections and 
abdominal pain. Risk factors include history of pelvic radiation, chemotherapy 
and abdominal surgery, as well as diverticular colonic disease, inflammatory 
bowel disease and traumatic pelvic injury. The paucity of cases reported in the 
literature makes the management of this threatening complication very 
challenging. Conservative treatment has only anecdotally been reported.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe two cases of entero-neovesical fistula with 
different presentation, which both required an immediate surgical treatment. The 
former patient was admitted to the emergency room with faecaluria, complete 
urinary incontinence and fever 2 years after radical cystectomy, and a fistula 
between the Y-shaped neobladder and the bowel anastomosis was detected. He had 
previously undergone chemotherapy because of tumour progression. Undiversion 
into an ileal conduit was required. The latter patient presented with faecaluria 
20 days after an uneventful radical cystectomy, and a fistula between the 
Vescica Ileale Padovana neobladder and the sigmoid was documented. Treatment 
included resection of the sigmoid with several small diverticula, temporary 
ileostomy and closure of the neobladder fistula.
CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment of entero-neovesical fistula can be attempted 
only in patients with small openings in the small bowel and no systemic 
symptoms. In all other cases, surgical treatment with bowel resection and either 
closure of the neobladder opening or undiversion should be the preferred option.

Standard radical cystectomy (RC) in women involves removal of the distal 
ureters, bladder, proximal urethra, uterus, ovaries, and adjacent vagina. 
Furthermore, pelvic organ-preserving RC to treat selected women has become an 
accepted technique and may confer better postoperative sexual and urinary 
functions than standard RC, avoiding complications such as incontinence, 
prolapse, neobladder-vaginal fistula (NVF), and sexual dysfunction, without 
compromising oncological outcome. This article reports a different surgical 
approach: a patient who underwent a cutaneous continent reservoir and neovagina 
construction using a previous ileal orthotopic neobladder after RC. Patient 
presented no complications and she has no evidence of recurrent disease and is 
sexually active, with a satisfactory continent reservoir. This case is the first 
report of this procedure that was able to treat concomitant dyspareunia caused 
by short vagina and neobladder-vaginal fistula. In conclusion, standard radical 
cystectomy with no vaginal preservation can have a negative impact on quality of 
life. In the present case, we successfully treated neobladder fistula and short 
vagina by transforming a previous ileal orthotopic neobladder into two parts: a 
continent reservoir and a neovagina. However, to establish the best approach in 
such patients, more cases with long-term follow-up are needed.

OBJECTIVE: To review surgical outcomes in urinary undiversions and describe 
short and long-term complications.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients who underwent urinary undiversion in 
our institution between May 2010 and May 2016. Complications were graded 
according to the Clavien classification. All patients completed the Patient 
Global Impression of Improvement questionnaire to indicate overall satisfaction 
with urinary undiversion.
RESULTS: Median time from the cystectomy to undiversion was 29 months (range 
11-53 months). Five patients (55%) reported significant distress related to the 
ileal conduit and were undiverted into an orthotopic neobladder. A female 
patient with an orthotopic neobladder and severe urinary incontinence received 
neobladder neck closure and catheterizable channel. Another female patient with 
an orthotopic neobladder was undiverted into an Indiana Pouch. Complications 
during the first 60 days were mostly minor, Clavien I (1 patient), 5 patients 
Clavien II, and a patient with Clavien IIIb. Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement questionnaire scores showed that 6 patients (67%) felt "Very much 
better" and 3 patients (33%) felt "Much better" after urinary undiversion 60%.
CONCLUSION: After urinary undiversions, minor complication rate is high, and 
major complication rate is considerable. Urinary undiversions are a highly 
complex, yet feasible procedure, which requires experienced multidisciplinary 
teams and demands appropriate patient selection. Patients, after undiversions 
show a high degree of satisfaction with long-term satisfactory outcomes, which 
points out the need for consideration for these procedures once the oncologic 
disease is controlled.

Objectives To report on the treatment of urethral recurrence after orthotopic 
urinary diversion at our institution. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 
clinical information of urethral recurrence in patients who underwent radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion between January 1998 and January 
2013. Results Of 341 patients, 282 presented for follow-up (median follow-up: 56 
months; range: 1-174 months). Eight patients developed local recurrence of 
urothelial cancer after radical cystectomy. The rate of urethral recurrence 
(1.4%) in female patients who underwent orthotopic urinary diversion was lower 
than in male patients (3.3%). The median (range) time to recurrence was 33 
(6-120) months after radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion. 
Recurrences were treated by transurethral resection of tumour, urethrectomy, 
neobladder resection, revision of urinary diversion, adjuvant chemotherapy, or 
radiation therapy, based on individual circumstances. Survival analysis showed 
that 5-year cancer-specific survival was significantly higher in patients with 
urethral recurrence alone (83.3%), compared with patients with other 
recurrences, including pelvic/abdomen recurrence and distant metastasis (26.8%). 
Conclusions En bloc urethrectomy and revision of urinary diversion remain the 
principle surgical choices. Selection of transurethral tumour resection was 
based on tumour stage and was used in carefully chosen patients. Cancer-specific 
survival might depend on multidisciplinary therapy.

PURPOSE: We report the perioperative outcomes and complications after transition 
from extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) to intracorporeal urinary diversion 
(ICUD) following robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
METHODS: Analysis of data from a prospectively maintained institutional review 
board-approved database of 180 patients treated with cystectomy at our 
institution from April 2015 to October 2017 was performed. 127 patients 
underwent RARC and received an ileal conduit. Only five patients received a 
neobladder after RARC and were excluded from analysis.
RESULTS: 68 patients had extracorporeal and 59 intracorporeal ileal conduit 
after RARC. There were no significant differences in patient demographics and 
oncological characteristics between the two groups. Of note, intracorporeal 
ileal conduit was associated with significantly reduced median total operative 
times (330 vs 375 min, p = 0.019), reduced median estimated blood loss (300 vs 
425 ml, p < 0.035) and lower 30-day overall complication rates (48.4 vs 71.4%, 
p = 0.008) when compared to extracorporeal diversion. However, the median length 
of stay, 30-90-day complication rates, mortality rates and ureteroileal 
anastomotic stricture rates were similar in both groups. The median operative 
time for RARC and intracorporeal ileal conduit was significantly shorter in the 
second cohort of 29 cases compared to the first 30 cases (300 vs 360 min, 
p = 0.004). Other outcomes were similar in both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: In our experience, transition from extracorporeal to intracorporeal 
diversion after RARC is safe, technically feasible and benefits from shorter 
operative times, reduced estimated blood loss, and lower 30-day overall 
complication rates.

PURPOSE: To assess long-term functional and oncologic outcomes of prostate 
sparing cystectomy (PSC) as a sexuality-preserving alternative to radical 
cystectomy in a selected group of bladder cancer (BC) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2014, 185 BC patients underwent PSC 
according to one of two standardized procedures at two centers. All patients had 
received extensive evaluation to rule out prostate cancer and BC at the bladder 
neck and prostatic urethra (PU), including prostate specific antigen blood 
analysis, transrectal ultrasound and/or prostate biopsies, PU biopsies and/or PU 
frozen section analysis. All patients received an orthotopic ileal neobladder. 
Overall survival (OS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cumulative 
incidence of cancer specific mortality, any recurrence and loco-regional 
recurrence were calculated using competing-risk methods. Finally, functional 
outcomes (voiding, continence and erectile function) were evaluated.
RESULTS: 185 patients (cTa-3N0M0) with a mean age of 57 years (SD: 9) were 
included. Median follow-up was 7.5 years (IQR: 5.6-10.8). Five-year OS was 71% 
and 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 31%. Twenty patients (10.8%) 
had a loco-regional recurrence, two recurrences were in the PU. During 
follow-up, prostate cancer was detected in six patients (3.2%). Erectile 
function was preserved in 86.1% of patients, complete daytime and nighttime 
continence in 95.6% and 70.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This two-center study shows that in men with BC in whom the prostate 
and PU were proven free of malignancy, PSC would represent a valid treatment 
option with excellent functional outcome. Oncologic outcomes were comparable to 
what is known from radical cystoprostatectomy series.

PURPOSE: The question of whether orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction is 
superior to ileal conduit diversion (ICD) with respect to health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) remains controversial. The goal of this study is to perform a 
meta-analysis to compare post-ICD and post-ONB HRQoL in patients with bladder 
cancer.
METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials, and the annual congress abstracts of the European 
Association of Urology (EAU), the American Urological Association (AUA) and the 
Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU) up to June 2017 was conducted to 
identify all relevant clinical trials using validated questionnaires to assess 
HRQoL. A systematic review and meta-analysis were then performed.
RESULTS: A total of 2507 patients from 26 eligible studies were included. 
Meta-analyses showed significant differences favouring ONB patients in global 
health status (WMD + 9.13, p = 0.004), physical functioning (WMD + 11.57, 
p = 0.0001), role functioning (WMD + 9.64, p = 0.002), and social functioning 
(WMD + 6.81, p = 0.03) based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire and in the total 
score of FACT questionnaire (WMD + 6.80, p = 0.001). However, ONB patients were 
more likely to have postoperative urinary symptoms than ICD patients (WMD 
- 22.19, p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: ONB patients are more likely to have a better global health status 
than ICD patients. Regardless of the type of urinary diversion (UD) surgery, a 
gradual improvement in HRQoL over preoperative status tended to stabilise after 
12 months postoperatively.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of continent urinary diversion on 
readmissions and hospital costs in a nationally representative sample of radical 
cystectomies (RCs) performed in the USA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried 
for patients with a diagnosis of bladder cancer who underwent RC. We identified 
patients undergoing continent (neobladder or continent cutaneous reservoir) or 
incontinent (ileal conduit) diversions. Multivariable logistic regression models 
were used to identify predictors of 90-day readmission, prolonged length of 
stay, and total hospital costs.
RESULTS: Amongst 21 126 patients identified, 19 437 (92.0%) underwent 
incontinent diversion and 1 689 (8.0%) had a continent diversion created. 
Continent diversion patients were younger, healthier, and treated at high-volume 
metropolitan centres. Continent diversions resulted in fewer in-hospital 
complications (37.3% vs 42.5%, P = 0.02) but led to more 90-day readmissions 
(46.5% vs 39.6%, P = 0.004). In addition, continent diversion patients were more 
often readmitted for infectious complications (38.7% vs 29.4%, P = 0.004) and 
genitourinary complications (18.5% vs 13.0%, P = 0.01). On multivariable 
logistic regression, patients with a continent diversion were more likely to be 
readmitted within 90 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.28, 1.88) and have increased hospital costs during initial hospitalisation (OR 
1.99, 95% CI: 1.52, 2.61). Continent diversion led to a $4 617 (American 
dollars) increase in initial hospital costs ($36 640 vs $32 023, P < 0.001), 
which was maintained at 30 days ($48 621 vs $44 231, P < 0.001) and at 90 days 
($56 380 vs $52 820, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In a nationally representative sample of RCs performed in the USA, 
continent urinary diversion led to more frequent readmissions and increased 
hospital costs. Interventions designed to address specific outpatient issues 
with continent diversions can potentially lead to a significant decrease in 
readmissions and associated hospital costs.

PURPOSE: To compare perioperative outcomes and complications of extracorporeal 
(ECUD) vs intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) in patients after undergoing 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) at five referral centers in France.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our multi-institutional, 
prospectively-collected database to select patients undergoing RARC between 2010 
and 2016 with at least 3 months of follow-up. At each center, the surgery was 
performed by one surgeon with extensive experience in robotic surgery and 
radical cystectomy but no prior experience in RARC.
RESULTS: Overall, 108 patients were included. ECUD and ICUD were performed in 34 
(31.5%) and 74 (68.5%) patients, respectively. Patient characteristics were 
comparable among the two groups, except for a higher proportion of patients with 
high surgical risk (ASA score ≥ 3) in the ECUD group. Ileal conduit and ileal 
neobladder were performed in 63/108 (58%) and 45/108 (42%) cases, respectively. 
Ileal conduit was performed more often with an extracorporeal approach while 
ileal neobladder with an intracorporeal approach. Overall, operative time, 
length of hospital stay, positive margin rate, and number of lymph nodes removed 
did not significantly differ among the two cohorts. Estimated blood loss and 
transfusion rates were significantly higher in the ECUD group. Rate of early 
(38.2 vs 47.3%, p = 0.4) and late (29.4 vs 18.9%, p = 0.2) surgical 
complications did not significantly differ between the ECUD and ICUD groups. 
Results were comparable in the subgroup analysis in the ileal conduit 
subpopulation.
CONCLUSION: In our real-life, multi-institutional study, RARC with ICUD achieved 
perioperative outcomes and complication rates comparable to those of RARC with 
ECUD.

Anastomotic stricture is a well-known complication of the urinary diversion that 
accompanies radical cystectomy. Management options range from endoscopic 
procedures to open surgeries, with a subset of the latter employing bowel as the 
interposing segment. In this report, we describe a rare patient, who 
successfully underwent a "Reverse 7" procedure, bypassing strictures at both 
anastomotic junctions between ureters and neobladder.

OBJECTIVE: We investigate the impact of the bowel suspension technique (BST) on 
paralytic ileus and early intestinal obstruction (≤60days) after radical 
cystectomy (RC) with ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 310 patients who underwent RC with IONB for 
bladder cancer between 2001 and 2017. After forming the Studer IONB, ileal 
continuity was restored by side-to-side stapled anastomosis. Then, we suspended 
stapled anastomotic portion of bowel on the posterior peritoneum not to fall 
into the pelvic cavity. The clinicopathologic characteristics of patients were 
examined and the onset of paralytic ileus and early intestinal obstruction were 
identified. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors 
associated with paralytic ileus and early intestinal obstruction.
RESULTS: Of the 310 total patients, paralytic ileus and early intestinal 
obstruction were identified in 100 (32.3%) and 15 (4.8%), respectively. When 
patients were divided into two groups (BST [-] vs. BST [+]), the rates of 
paralytic ileus were not significantly different (64/205[31.2%] vs. 
36/105[34.3%], P = 0.585). However, early intestinal obstruction that required 
surgical treatment was significantly decreased (14/205[6.8%] vs. 1/105[1.0%], 
P = 0.024). On multivariate analysis, older age was commonly associated with 
paralytic ileus and early intestinal obstruction (P = 0.008 and P = 0.016). BST 
was inversely associated with early intestinal obstruction (95% CI: 0.01-0.85, 
P = 0.034), but not related to paralytic ileus.
CONCLUSION: BST significantly reduced early intestinal obstruction without 
increasing paralytic ileus after RC with IONB. BST could be used as useful 
technique to reduce severe bowel complications.

AIM: In this study, we compared perioperative and oncologic outcomes of patients 
treated with either open or robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal 
neobladder at a tertiary care center.
METHODS: The institutional prospective bladder cancer database was queried for 
"cystectomy with curative intent" and "neobladder". All patients underwent 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal neobladder or open radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer or muscle invasive bladder cancer with a follow-up length ≥2 years were 
included. A 1:1 propensity score matching analysis was used. Kaplan-Meier method 
was performed to compare oncologic outcomes of selected cohorts. Survival rates 
were computed at 1,2,3 and 4 years after surgery and the log rank test was 
applied to assess statistical significance between the matched groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 363 patients (299 open and 64 robotic) were included. Open 
radical cystectomy patients were more frequently male (p = 0.08), with higher pT 
stages (p = 0.003), lower incidence of urothelial histologies (p = 0.05) and 
lesser adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<0.001). After applying the 
propensity score matching, 64 robot-assisted radical cystectomy patients were 
matched with 46 open radical cystectomy cases (all p ≥ 0.22). Open cohort showed 
a higher rate of perioperative overall complications (91.3% vs 42.2%, p 0.001). 
At Kaplan-Meier analysis robotic and open cohorts displayed comparable 
disease-free survival (log-rank p = 0.746), cancer-specific survival (p = 0.753) 
and overall-survival rates (p = 0.909).
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal neobladder 
provides comparable oncologic outcomes of open radical cystectomy and orthotopic 
neobladder at intermediate term survival analysis.

AIMS: Continent urinary diversion is preferred by some patients and orthotopic 
urinary diversion (OUD) has become the procedure of choice for most men 
following cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer. OUD in women, however, is less 
common, likely due to a high rate of hypercontinence (HC), potentially from lax 
support of pelvic structures similar to pelvic organ prolapse. As such, we 
evaluated if abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) at the time of OUD in women led to 
decreased rates of HC.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all female patients receiving OUD by a single 
surgeon and ASC was performed. ASC was performed after RC was complete prior to 
the urethro-enteric anastomosis. Peritoneal flap was created to the vaginal 
apex. The distal leaf was then sutured to the proximal anterior vaginal wall and 
apex and the proximal end sutured to the anterior longitudinal ligament. HC was 
defined as the need to perform intermittent catheterization (IC) due to 
incomplete emptying of the neobladder.
RESULTS: Nine women underwent cystectomy with OUD and concurrent ASC during the 
specified time period. Average patient age was 54 years (27-69). Mean followup 
was 61.6 months (5-123 months). None of those who underwent ASC had HC or 
incontinence post-operatively. No mesh-related complications were noted in this 
cohort. Pelvic abscess was noted in one patient who underwent ASC with rectus 
fascia.
CONCLUSIONS: ASC at the time of radical cystectomy and OUD is safe and 
effective. It appears to be associated with decreased rates of HC and is 
associated with minimal additional morbidity to the patient.

Approximately 1 in 5 new cases of clinically localized bladder cancer is muscle 
invasive and requires the patient to choose from 1 of 2 prevailing options for 
treatment: radical cystectomy or radiation to the bladder. However, these 
treatments are associated with detrimental effects on patient well-being and 
quality of life, particularly with respect to functional independence, urinary 
and sexual function, social and emotional health, body image, and psychosocial 
stress. Compared with the literature on other malignancies like breast or 
prostate cancer, high-quality studies evaluating the effects of bladder cancer 
treatment on quality of life are lacking.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence rate of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and 
associated pathogens between patients with ileal conduit and patients with 
orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 179 patients treated with radical 
cystectomy between 2006 and 2011 were reviewed and data pertaining to 
postoperative UTI were collected. UTI incidence was reported at 3 months' 
intervals and compared by diversion type. Preoperative predictors of UTI were 
evaluated with Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 130 patients with ileal conduit and 49 
patients with orthotopic neobladder. Patients with a neobladder were younger 
(P <.001). Median follow-up was 38 months (IQR [interquartile range], 11-63). 
Median time from surgery to first infection was 1.5 months (IQR, 1-12.5) for 
patients with a neobladder and 11 months (IQR, 2.5-27) for patients with a 
conduit (P = .04). During the first 3 months after surgery, 29% of the patients 
with a neobladder and 8% of the patients with ileal conduit had a UTI episode 
(P = .001). Rates of UTI did not differ during subsequent follow-up. Diversion 
type was not associated with UTI on multivariable analysis. Escherichia coli was 
the most common pathogen in patients with a conduit (58%), and Klebsiella spp. 
in patients with a neobladder (29%).
CONCLUSION: The risk of UTI is significantly higher in patients with a 
neobladder during the first 3 months after surgery and comparable to patients 
with ileal conduit during subsequent follow-up. These findings may facilitate 
preoperative counseling regarding the expected risk of UTI after urinary 
diversion.

INTRODUCTION: Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) and ileal conduit (IC) are the most 
commonly practiced techniques of urinary diversion (UD) after radical cystectomy 
(RC) in bladder cancer patients. Data in the literature is still discordant 
regarding which UD technique offers the best HR-QoL.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare HR-QoL in patients undergoing ONB and IC 
after RC, through a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a literature search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, 
CochraneLibrary and ClinicalTrials.Gov in September 2017 according to the 
Cochrane Handbook and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyzes. The studies were evaluated according to the "Oxford Center for 
Evidence-Based Medicine" criteria. The outcome measures evaluated were 
subdomains' scores of Bladder Cancer Index BCI: urinary function (UF), urinary 
bother (UB), bowel function (BF), bowel bother (BB), sexual function (SF) and 
sexual bother (SB). Continuous outcomes were compared using weighted means 
differences, with 95% confidence intervals. The presence of publication bias was 
examined by funnel plots.
RESULTS: Four studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled results 
demonstrated better UF and UB scores in IC patients: differences were -18.17 
(95% CI: -27.49, -8.84, P=0.0001) and -3.72 (95% CI: -6.66, -0.79, P=0.01) 
respectively. There was no significant difference between IC and ONB patients in 
terms of BF and BB. SF was significantly better in ONB patients: the difference 
was 12.7 (95% CI, 6.32, 19.08, P<0.0001). However no significant difference was 
observed regarding SB.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis of non-randomized studies demonstrated a better 
HR-QoL in urinary outcomes in IC patients compared with ONB patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: More than a century of development has led to contemporary 
urinary diversion. It is paramount that robotic intracorporeal diversions uphold 
the principles defined by open surgery.
RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we discuss the fundamental open surgical 
principles that have led to contemporary techniques of urinary diversion. We 
then outline the technical aspects of several recently described robotic 
intracorporeal urinary diversions in the context of these surgical principles. 
Several potential benefits of intracorporeal urinary diversion are being 
investigated-such as a reduction in gastrointestinal complications, ureteral 
strictures, and wound complications. Finally, we highlight the important aspects 
of establishing an intracorporeal urinary diversion program integrated with an 
Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) program. We have included the 
perioperative outcomes of 100 consecutive cases of intracorporeal urinary 
diversion with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocol. In this 
series, 49% were continent diversions. Patients had a median length of stay of 
5 days, with 37% staying 4 days or less. High-grade complications and 
readmissions were noted in 22 and 20% of patients, respectively. The benefits of 
intracorporeal urinary diversion appear promising, and there is continued need 
for high-quality randomized controlled trials to define its role in patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) outcomes in 
elderly patients with different type of urinary diversion (UD), ileal conduit 
(IC) and ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB), after radical cystectomy (RC) for 
bladder cancer, by using validated self-reported cancer-specific instruments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 77 patients who received an IC 
or an IONB after RC. HR-QoL was assessed with specific and validated disease 
questionnaires, administered at last follow-up.
RESULT: At univariate analysis, at a mean follow-up of 60.91 ± 5.63 months, IONB 
results were favourable with regard to the following HR-QoL aspects: nausea and 
vomiting (p = 0.045), pain (p = 0.049), appetite loss (p = 0.03), constipation 
(p = 0.000), financial impact (p = 0.012) and cognitive functioning (p = 0.000). 
This last functional aspect was significantly worse in female patients (p = 
0.029). Emotional functioning was significantly better in patients without 
long-term complications (p = 0.016). At multivariate analysis, male gender and 
IONB were independent predictors of better cognitive functioning, while 
long-term complications negatively affected emotional functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results suggest that an IONB can also be suitable for 
elderly patients compared with an IC with few and selected advantages in favour 
of the former UD. Preoperative patient's selection, counselling, education and 
active participation in the decision-making process lead to a more suitable 
choice of treatment.

PURPOSE: To analyze the feasibility and perioperative results of patients 
undergoing robot-assisted cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion and 
robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis.
METHODS: This is a mono-centric analysis of perioperative data from 48 
consecutive patients undergoing robot-assisted cystectomy with intracorporeal 
urinary diversion and robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis. Data include the 
preoperative variables, operative and postoperative course and complication 
rates related to bowel anastomosis. End points were time spent for anastomosis 
and intra- and postoperative complication rates.
RESULTS: Median operating time was 23.0 (13-60) min for the ileoileal 
anastomosis. Median overall operating time was 295 (200-780) min, with a median 
of 282 (200-418) min and 414.0 (225-780) min for the ileum conduit (N = 35) and 
ileal neobladder (N = 13). Two patients developed paralytic ileus; in another 
patient acute peritonitis occurred, but was caused by urinary leakage and 
therefore unrelated to the bowel anastomosis. No anastomotic leakage was 
noticed. Costs for the robot-sewn anastomosis was 8€ compared to 1250€ for a 
stapled anastomosis which was performed in previous cases. Limitations are the 
non-comparative nature of the analysis and the limited number of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis is feasible with low complication 
rates. Compared to the stapled anastomosis, a robot-sewn ileoileal anastomosis 
may serve as an alternative and cost-saving approach.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery pathways after radical cystectomy attempt to 
decrease length of hospitalization, but might increase risk of readmission after 
discharge. We evaluated the relationship between length of stay and readmission 
after uncomplicated hospitalization for bladder cancer patients treated with 
radical cystectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program database, we identified bladder cancer patients who 
were treated with radical cystectomy from 2011 to 2015. We limited this cohort 
to those who did not have complications captured while in-hospital, and assessed 
the proportion readmitted within 30 days of surgery on the basis of length of 
stay (ie, < 7, 7-9, ≥ 10 days). We fit multivariable logistic regression models 
to estimate odds of readmission after adjusting for potential confounding 
factors.
RESULTS: Among 4624 patients treated with radical cystectomy, 1003 (21.7%) were 
readmitted within 30 days of surgery. Of 1,003 readmitted patients, 503 (50%) 
experienced a major complication after discharge. Factors associated with an 
increased risk of readmission included diversion with neobladder, diabetes, 
prolonged surgical time, and obesity (all P < .01). Patients with 
hospitalization < 7 days were not at increased risk of readmission compared with 
those with prolonged stays (354/1769, 20.0% < 7 days vs. 201/968, 20.8% ≥ 10 
days, adjusted odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.21).
CONCLUSION: In the absence of in-hospital complications after radical 
cystectomy, shorter hospitalizations were not associated with an increased risk 
of readmission. These findings emphasize the safety and potential cost savings 
of enhanced recovery pathways after these complex operations.

BACKGROUND: After radical cystoprostatectomy (RC), postoperative erectile 
dysfunction (ED) is a common consequence with multiple contributing etiologies. 
The inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) offers patients a definitive treatment 
option when ED is refractory to medical therapies. Because of the hostile 
postoperative anatomy of these patients, a careful surgical approach is 
necessary for successful outcomes and to avoid adjacent organ injury. To date, 
there is no series describing the outcomes of 3-piece IPP placement in patients 
with urinary diversions.
AIM: To present contemporary outcomes and a description of our technique in 
placing a 3-piece IPP for postoperative ED in patients with a history of RC with 
orthotopic neobladder, ileal conduit, or continent cutaneous diversion.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 80 patients who underwent primary placement 
of a 3-piece IPP (AMS 700; American Medical Systems Inc, Minnetonka, MN, USA) 
after RC and urinary diversion from 2003 through 2016. 79 patients underwent RC 
in their treatment of urologic malignancy (71 for bladder cancer, 8 for prostate 
cancer) and 1 underwent RC for refractory interstitial cystitis. An infrapubic 
approach was used in most patients, with reservoir placement in the lateral 
retroperitoneal space through a counterincision medial to the anterior superior 
iliac spine. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative 
outcomes including prosthetic infection and mechanical failure were examined and 
statistical analysis was performed.
OUTCOMES: Rates of device infection, revision surgery, and reservoir 
complications.
RESULTS: After mean follow-up of 53.9 months (6.5-150.7 months), 4 patients 
developed infection of the prosthesis that required explantation. 3 of those 
patients underwent successful IPP reimplantation. 5 patients required revision 
surgery (pump replacement, n = 3; pump relocation, n = 1; cylinder replacement 
for cylinder aneurysm, n = 1) for mechanical failure. No statistically 
significant associations were found between infection and comorbidities, urinary 
diversion, exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, or presence of an artificial 
urinary sphincter.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The 3-piece IPP is an effective treatment option for 
medication-refractory ED that can be placed safely in patients with all forms of 
urinary diversion.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This study represents the 1st series that describes a 
successful technique and long-term outcomes of patients with urinary diversion. 
It is limited by its single-surgeon, single-center experience and lacks 
validated patient satisfaction data in follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3-piece IPP, with reservoir placement in the lateral 
retroperitoneum, can be implanted successfully in patients with all forms of 
urinary diversion without a significant increase in infectious complications, 
reservoir erosion, or mechanical failure. Loh-Doyle J, Patil MB, Sawkar H,

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) with ileal conduit (IC) or continent 
diversion (CD) is standard treatment for high-risk non-invasive and 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to study contemporary trends in the utilization of ICs and 
CDs in patients undergoing RC.
METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample 2001-2012, we identified all 
patients diagnosed with a malignant bladder neoplasm who underwent RC followed 
by IC or CD. Patient demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), and 
in-hospital complications, mortality, and costs were compared. Multivariable 
logistic regression analysis, Chi square, and t-tests were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Between 2001-2012, approximately 69,049 ICs and 6,991 CDs were 
performed. CDs increased from 2001 to 2008, but declined after 2008 
(p < 0.0001). Patients of all ages received ICs at a higher rate than CDs (40-59 
years: 79.5% vs. 20.5%; 60-69 years: 88.0% vs. 12.0%; p < 0.0001). There was a 
difference in males vs. females (10.2% vs. 4.0%; OR 2.36) and Caucasians vs. 
African Americans (9.0% vs. 6.7%; OR 1.49) when comparing CD rates. CD rates 
were highest in the West, urban teaching centers, and large hospitals 
(p < 0.001). ICs were associated with higher rates of overall postoperative 
complications (p = 0.0185) including infection (p = 0.002) and mortality 
(p < 0.0001). In-hospital costs were greater for the CD group.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of CDs has declined recently. Patients of all ages are 
more likely to receive ICs than CDs. Gender, racial, and geographic disparities 
exist among those receiving CDs. CDs are associated with lower rates of 
in-hospital complications and mortality, but higher in-hospital costs.

BACKGROUND: To compare the results of urethral anastomosis to a button hole and 
to the lowest part of the anterior suture line during orthotopic neobladder 
substitution.
METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2015, 87 consecutive male patients with 
invasive bladder cancer underwent radical cystectomy and Hautmann ileal 
neobladder. Patients were randomly divided into two groups; group I (44 
patients), the outlet was created as a button-hole at the most dependent part of 
the pouch, group II (43 patients), the lowest 1 cm of the anterior suture line 
of the pouch was left open as an outlet. Patients were randomly assigned to 
either group using computer-generated random numbers (JMP, Version 12.0.1; SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) via a sealed envelope. The functional outcomes of both 
groups were compared especially at the urethro-enteric anastomosis.
RESULTS: There were no intraoperative complications. Early postoperative 
complications occurred in 9 patients (5 in group I and 4 in group II, 
p = 0.484). Prolonged urinary leakage persisted for 11 and 14 days in 2 patients 
in group I and 10 and 16 days in 2 patients in group II. Delayed postoperative 
complications occurred in 11 patients (5 [12.5%] in group I and 6 [15.6%] in 
group II) (p = 0.711). Three patients developed urethro-enteric strictures (2 in 
group I and 1 in group II) (p = 0.571).
CONCLUSION: The "non-hole" technique of urethral anastomosis was not associated 
with a significant increase in the complication rate when compared to the 
commonly performed "hole" technique.

PURPOSE: Postoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) can be measured after 
major abdominal surgery to predict of complications at postoperative day (POD) 
4. However, in urology, no studies have been conduced to analyze the role of CRP 
after radical cystectomy. The present study aims to analyze the relationship 
between a high postoperative level of CRP and the presence of complications 
after radical cystectomy for cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included 313 
patients treated with radical cystectomy for cancer between January 2013 and 
July 2016. Among the patients, 57.5% of patients received urinary diversion 
using a Bricker ileal conduit, 30.5% an orthotropic ileal neobladder, and 11.5% 
had an ureterocutaneostomy.
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirteen patients were included (mean age 68.1±9.2 
years). Among the patients, 26.5% had grade≥2 complications, according to the 
Clavien-Dindo classification. In multivariate analysis, only CRP level at POD 4 
predicted the risk of a complication (P<0.001). CRP>150mg/L at POD 4 was 
strongly associated with a risk of a postoperative complication after a 
cystectomy (OR=81.42, 95% CI [25.6-258.3], P<0.001). CRP assessed on POD4 was 
reliable at ruling out the existence of an infectious complications with a 
negative predictive value of 0.94. The main limitation of our study was it 
observational design.
CONCLUSIONS: CRP at POD4 with a threshold of 150mg/L would reliably predict the 
risk of postoperative complications after cystectomy. Monitoring postoperative 
CRP could help adapt rehabilitation protocols after radical cystectomy and also 
the early management of complications.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe our initial Australian single 
surgeon experience with robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and 
intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) and to compare the outcomes with open 
radical cystectomy (ORC).
METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2016, consecutive patients diagnosed with 
muscle invasive and high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer undergoing 
radical cystectomy were included. Treatment modalities included either RARC with 
ICUD or ORC. ICUD consisted of either intracorporeal ileal conduit or orthotopic 
neobladder formation. Prospectively collected perioperative and oncological 
outcomes were analysed.
RESULTS: Twenty-six RARC and 13 ORC were performed. Median operating times were 
362 and 240 min for RARC and ORC, respectively (P < 0.001). Estimated blood loss 
for RARC was 300 mL compared with 500 mL for ORC (P = 0.01). Post-operative 
haemoglobin drop was less in the RARC cohort (20% versus 24%, P = 0.03). There 
was no statistical difference in overall 90-day complication rates (81% versus 
62%, P = 0.25) and 90-day major complication rates (19% versus 23%, P = 0.67) 
between the RARC and ORC groups, respectively. Positive surgical margins for 
RARC were 4% and 8% for ORC (P = 1.0).
CONCLUSION: Early results demonstrate that the safe introduction of RARC with 
ICUD in Australia is potentially feasible without compromising perioperative and 
oncological outcomes. Future randomized trial with larger numbers will be 
required for further analysis in the Australian setting.

A 34-year-old man, diagnosed with paraganglioma of the urinary bladder, was 
referred to our hospital. Computed tomography showed a bladder tumor measuring 
64 mm along with right obturator lymphadenopathy. Abnormal uptake was observed 
on 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. The tumor was, therefore, diagnosed as malignant 
paraganglioma. We performed cystectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and 
neobladder reconstruction. Pathological examination revealed a malignant 
paraganglioma of the urinary bladder with right obturator lymph node metastasis. 
Postoperatively, both the uptake on 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and catecholamine 
levels in blood and urine normalized. However, 22 months later, positoron 
emission tomography-computed tomography showed the presence of 2 recurrent 
tumors in the pelvis. The patient underwent 9 courses of cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy and MIBG radiotherapy twice, following 
which the tumor size decreased by 35% and catecholamine levels normalized once 
again. At about 2 years of follow-up, the patient was found to be free of 
recurrence.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to determine the most frequent early and 
late complications in different types of ileal urinary diversions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a five-year period, on 106 
patients who were diagnosed with invasive urinary bladder cancer and who had 
indication for radical cystectomy with one of the investigated types of urine 
derivation. They were divided into 2 groups, based on the type of ileal urinary 
diversions.
RESULTS: The colonization of bacteria was more prominently present in the ileal 
conduit urinary diversion group (97%) compared to Ghoneim (25%) and Hautmann 
(10%) group, Ureteral stenosis was slightly less represented in the conduit 
group (9.1%). Wound infections were significantly more represented in the 
conduit (21.2%) than in the Ghoneim group (5%) Nighttime incontinence was 
present in 20% of patients in both groups or 4 patients in each group. Daytime 
incontinence in the Ghoneim group was present in 3 patients (15%) and in the 
Hautmann group 2 patients (10%). Late complications correlate significantly 
negative with the type of surgery and slightly negative with the grade, and 
significantly positively with the examined group and T stage, and slightly 
correlate positively to the N and R stages. Early complications correlate 
slightly negative with the type of surgery, slightly negative with the grade, 
and significantly positively with T stage, and slightly positively correlates 
with the N and R stage.
CONCLUSION: The most commonly reported complications in ileal conduit are: 
prolonged ileus, stoma infection, wound dehiscence and bacterial colonization, 
followed by peristomal skin complications and complications related only to the 
stoma, such as stenosis and stoma retraction, and prolaps of ileostoma and 
ileointestinal stenosis. The ileus rate in orthotopic derivation was 
significantly lower than that of the ileal conduit group, which led to the 
conclusion that the neomybladder position does not disturb the anatomic 
abdominal structure.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the evolution in radical cystectomy (RC) care over 11 
years at a referral centre.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of patients undergoing either open RC 
(ORC) or robot-assisted RC (RARC) for cT1-4aN0M0 bladder cancer (BCa) at our 
centre between January 2006 and December 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. 
Crude and propensity score-weighted log-binomial regression analyses were 
conducted to assess the association between pre- and peri-operative variables 
and the risk of reoperation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death <90 
days after RC.
RESULTS: A total of 814 patients were considered. The percentage of RARCs 
performed increased (from 10% to 100%) between 2006 and 2013. Overall, 29% of 
the patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (12-37% from 2006 to 2016). 
Despite no differences in terms of operating time, pelvic lymph node dissection 
(PLND) was more commonly attempted during RARC and extended PLND was more 
frequently performed in the RARC group (72% vs 19%; P < 0.001). Ileal conduit 
was the preferred urinary diversion in both groups, and more patients in the 
RARC group underwent neobladder construction (34% vs 14%; P < 0.001). The 
overall rates of re-intervention, ICU admission and death within 90 days of RC 
were 8.9%, 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively. On crude analysis, RARC was associated 
with a reduced risk of ICU admission (relative risk [RR] 0.42, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.23-0.77; P = 0.005), reintervention (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.90; 
P = 0.015) and death (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85; P = 0.020); however, these risk 
reductions were not statistically significant on weighted analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of RARC has coincided with a reduction in the rate 
of ICU admission, reoperation and death within 90 days of surgery, without 
compromising operating time, PLND extent or neobladder utilization.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Studies comparing health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) 
between patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) and those who underwent a 
different form of urinary diversion has not reached yet univocal and reliable 
conclusions. The aim of our study was to evaluate bladder-specific long-term 
HR-QoL after radical cystectomy and ileal conduit.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter study was carried out on 145 consecutive 
patients (112 males and 33 females) undergoing RC and ileal conduit (IC). HR-QoL 
assessment was conducted using Italian versions of European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and EORTC BLM-30 questionnaires.
RESULTS: Our data showed that women who underwent IC presented greater problems 
than men in cognitive functioning (mean score±SD: 77.3±27.9 vs. 87.8±18.6) as 
well in future perspective (score: 42.4±34.4 vs. 21.9±24.6). Nevertheless, men 
undergoing IC had more problems in sexual functioning than women (score: 
23.3±24.5 vs. 7.0±20.3) (all p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: In our series, female patients presented a greater burden than male 
patients in cognitive functioning as well in future perspective, but lower 
concerns with regard to sexual function.

Center, New York, New York, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
urinary diversion (ICUD) is being increasingly performed worldwide. This review 
summarizes recent technical developments and outcome data for RARC with ICUD.
RECENT FINDINGS: With the recent description of intracorporeal continent 
cutaneous diversion, all classes of urinary diversion can presently be performed 
totally intracorporeally. The summary of our seven cases of intracorporeal 
continent cutaneous diversion in this article brings the number of reported 
cases in the literature to 17. Additional recent advancements in ICUD focus on 
novel technical descriptions and outcome data. Several intracorporeal orthotopic 
ileal neobladder techniques have been described with intermediate perioperative 
outcomes. There is some rationale for reduced overall, wound, gastrointestinal 
and genitourinary complications with ICUD.
SUMMARY: RARC with intracorporeal diversion is a feasible option for patients 
with bladder cancer. Prospective and randomized outcome data are needed to 
better characterize the benefit of ICUD in patients following radical 
cystectomy.

PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of urinary diversion type following radical 
cystectomy (RC) on readmission and short-term mortality rates.
METHODS: Patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer in the National Cancer 
Data Base were grouped based on the type of urinary diversion performed: 
non-continent [ileal conduit (IC)] or two continent techniques [continent pouch 
(CP) and orthotopic neobladder (NB)]. We used propensity score matching and 
multivariable logistic regression models to compare 30-day readmission and 30- 
and 90-day mortality between the different types of urinary diversion.
RESULTS: Among 11,933 patients who underwent RC, we identified 10,197 (85.5%) 
IC, 1044 (8.7%) CP, and 692 (5.8%) NB. Patients who received IC were 
significantly older and had more comorbidities (p < 0.0001). Continent 
diversions were more likely to be performed at an academic center (p < 0.0001). 
Surgery performed at a non-academic center was an independent predictor of 
30-day readmission (OR 1.19, p = 0.010) and 30-day mortality (OR 1.27, 
p = 0.043). Patients undergoing NB had an increased likelihood of being 
readmitted (OR 1.41, p = 0.010). There was no significant difference in 
short-term mortality between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing NB had marginally increased rates of 
readmission compared to IC. Surgery performed at a non-academic center was 
associated with higher readmission and 30-day mortality. Similar short-term 
mortality rates were observed among the different types of urinary diversion.

PURPOSE: Currently, identified factors for urethral recurrence (UR) are based on 
individual reporting which has displayed controversy. In addition, risk of UR is 
one of the limiting factors to offer neobladder diversion during radical 
cystectomy (RC). We aim to systematically evaluate the incidence and risk 
factors of UR post-RC and its effect on survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic online search was conducted according to 
PRISMA statement for publications reporting on UR after RC. From initial 802 
results, 14 articles including 6169 patients were included finally after 
exclusion of ineligible studies.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of UR was 4.4% (1.3%-13.7%). It was significantly 
lower with neobladder diversion (odds ratio = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.24-0.79, P = 
0.006). Muscle invasion (hazard ratio = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.86-1.62, P = 0.31), 
carcinoma in situ (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI: 0.64-1.47, P = 0.88), prostatic 
stromal involvement (hazard ratio = 2.26, 95% CI: 0.01-627.75, P = 0.78), and 
prostatic urethral involvement (hazard ratio = 2.04, 95% CI: 0.20-20.80, P = 
0.55) have no significant effect on UR. Men displayed tendency toward higher 
incidence of UR (odds ratio = 2.21, 95% CI: 0.96-5.06, P = 0.06). Absence of 
recurrence displayed tendency toward better disease specific survival, yet not 
significant (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.66-1.08, P = 0.17). These results 
are limited by the retrospective nature of the included studies.
CONCLUSION: Muscle invasion, carcinoma in situ and prostatic stromal or urethral 
involvement at time of RC have no significant effect on UR. Orthotopic 
neobladder is associated with a significant lower risk of UR after RC.

In 2018, robot-assisted radical cystectomy will enter its 15th year. In an era 
where an effort is being made to standardize complication reporting and videos 
of the procedure are readily available, it is inevitable and justified that like 
everything novel, robot-assisted radical cystectomy should be scrutinized 
against the gold standard, open radical cystectomy. The present comparison is 
focused on several parameters: oncological, functional and complication 
outcomes, and direct and indirect costs. Meta-analysis and prospective 
randomized trials comparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open 
radical cystectomy have been published, showing an oncological equivalence and 
in some cases an advantage of robot-assisted radical cystectomy in terms of 
postoperative morbidity. In the present review, we attempt to update the 
available knowledge on this debate and discuss the limitations of the current 
evidence that prevent us from drawing safe conclusions.

Orthotopic neobladder is a viable option for women undergoing cystectomy for 
bladder cancer, with excellent oncologic outcomes and a low incidence of 
urethral recurrence. Careful patient selection is important, as is developing a 
clear understanding by the patient and her family in what to expect with an 
orthotopic diversion. Surgical technique is also important in optimizing 
functional outcomes, such as continence, sexual function, and decreased rate of 
vaginal fistula formation, and urinary retention.

Successful outcome with orthotopic neobladders begins in the preoperative phase 
with appropriate patient selection and extensive patient counseling. Meticulous 
attention to surgical and oncological principles is required to optimize 
neobladder outcomes. Long-term follow-up is needed not only for oncological 
purposes but also to monitor for the late complications, such as 
ureterointestinal strictures, renal deterioration, infections, and voiding 
dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE: To describe our step-by-step technique for robotic intracorporeal 
neobladder configuration, including the stages of conception, development and 
exploration of this surgical innovation, according to the Idea, Development, 
Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) Collaboration guidelines.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Florence robotic intracorporeal neobladder (FloRIN) 
was performed employing the following main surgical steps: isolation of 50 cm of 
ileum; bowel anastomosis; urethro-ileal anastomosis creating an asymmetrical 
'U'-shape (30 cm distally and 20 cm proximally to anastomosis), ileum 
detubularisation; posterior wall reconfiguration as an 'L'; bladder neck 
reconstruction; anterior folding of the posterior plate to reach the 12 o'clock 
position; uretero-enteral 'orthotopic' bilateral anastomosis. The conception and 
development of the FloRIN followed the IDEAL guidelines recommended stages: 
Phase 1 (simulation) involved the neobladder robotic configuration using 
silicone models. Phase 2a (development) aimed to reproduce the configuration in 
an open fashion in one patient, and then in the first three robotic procedures. 
Phase 2b (exploration) consisted of the technique standardisation in 15 
consecutive robotic approaches. Phase 2a and 2b included urodynamics and imaging 
assessment of the patients treated.
RESULTS: From February 2016 to September 2017 FloRIN was performed in 18 
patients. Comparing the first three (Phase 2a) with the subsequent 15 patients 
(Phase 2b), the median (interquartile range [IQR]) reconstruction operating time 
was 260 (220-340) vs 160 (150-210) min, respectively. Postoperative surgical 
complications occurred in four of the 18 patients (22.1%), including one 
surgical Clavien-Dindo Grade III and three Grade I, postoperative medical 
Clavien-Dindo Grade II complications occurred in three (16.7%) patients. On 
urodynamic examination (available in nine [50%] patients) the median (IQR) 
reservoir cystometric capacity, compliance, and post-void residual were 240 
(220-267) mL, 18 (12.5-19.8) mL/cmH2 O, and 0 (0-50) mL, respectively. 
Ultrasonography showed no Grade ≥2 vesico-ureteric reflux.
CONCLUSION: We describe the FloRIN configuration, showing its technical 
feasibility with acceptable time efficiency. The first cases studied had good 
reservoir capacity, low pressure with no reflux, and complete voiding.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cumulative effect of an enhanced recovery after surgery 
(ERAS) pathway and minimally invasive robot-assisted radical cystectomy with 
intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC) in comparison with open radical 
cystectomy (ORC) on length of hospital stay (LOS) and peri-operative outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2009 and October 2017, 304 radical 
cystectomy cases were performed at a single institution (ORC, n = 54; 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy [RARC], n = 250). Data were prospectively 
collected. We identified 45 consecutive ORC cases performed without ERAS before 
the commencement of the RARC programme (Cohort A), 50 consecutive iRARC cases 
performed without ERAS (Cohort B) and 40 iRARC cases with ERAS (Cohort C). The 
primary outcome measure was LOS, while secondary outcome measures included 
peri-operative 90-day complications and readmission rate. Complications were 
accessed using the Clavien-Dindo system.
RESULTS: Patients in all cohorts were evenly matched with regard to age, sex, 
body mass index, neoadjuvant treatment, tumour stage, lymph node yield, previous 
pelvic radiotherapy and surgery, peri-operative anaemia, as well as 
physiological state. Patients who underwent iRARC with ERAS had a significantly 
higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (III-IV) and were more likely 
to receive neobladder reconstruction. The median (interquartile range) LOS was 
shorter in the iRARC with ERAS group (7 [6-10]) days than in the iRARC without 
ERAS group (11 [8-15]) days and the ORC group (17 [14-21] days). In a propensity 
score-matched cohort of patients who underwent iRARC, patients who followed the 
ERAS pathway had significantly lower 90-day readmission rates. Additionally, 
implementing ERAS in an iRARC cohort resulted in a significantly lower 90-day 
all (P < 0.001) and gastrointestinal-related complications (P = 0.001). The ERAS 
pathway and younger patients were independently associated with an LOS of 
≤10 days on multinomial logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: A comprehensive ERAS programme can significantly reduce LOS in 
patients undergoing iRARC without increasing 90-day readmission rates. An ERAS 
programme can augment the benefits of iRARC in improving peri-operative 
outcomes. In studies comparing ORC and RARC, the presence or absence of an ERAS 
programme will be a confounding factor and only level 1 evidence can be 
interpreted reliably.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the length of ileum used for ileal orthotopic 
neobladder (ONB) reconstruction (60 cm vs. 40 cm) after radical cystectomy (RC) 
for bladder cancer (BC) impacts on bowel function, postoperative complications 
or survival outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 56 patients who 
received an ONB (Studer (S)-Pouch: 23 patients; I-Pouch: 33 patients) after RC 
for BC between 2003 and 2011. Preoperative comorbidities were assessed by the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and surgical complications as graded by the 
Clavien-Dindo classification. Changes of perioperative bowel habits were 
retrospectively evaluated by the validated Gastrointestinal Quality of Life 
Index (GIQLI). Kaplan-Meier analyses calculated survival outcomes between both 
ONB types.
RESULTS: Preoperative CCI was comparable between S- and I-pouch patients. No 
significant differences were observed for 30-day major- (p = 0.33) and minor 
(p = 0.96) complication rates between both neobladder types. S-Pouch patients 
reported higher preoperative stool frequencies (S-pouch: mean 2.7; I-pouch: mean 
3.4; p = 0.049) and tended to suffer from urgency (S: mean 2.9; I: mean 3.4; 
p = 0.059). No significant differences in postoperative bowel disorders were 
found between both neobladder types (S-Pouch: 15.9, IQR; I-Pouch: 16.6 IQR; 
p = 0.84). Furthermore, we observed no overall-, cancer specific- or recurrence 
free survival advantage for either of both ONB variants (p = 0.81; 0.65 and 
0.78), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Comorbidities, perioperative complication rates and bowel habits 
were similar between both ONB substitutes and did not influence survival 
outcomes. These stratified data suggest that the length of ileum used for ONB 
reconstruction (60- vs. 40 cm) does not impact per se on postoperative bowel 
function.

OBJECTIVES: To validate the Arabic version of the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-Bladder (FACT-Bl) questionnaire in Egyptian patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy (RC) and orthotopic neobladder (ONB) construction.
PATIENTS SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The English version of the FACT-Bl was translated 
into the Arabic language using multi-step process by two urologist and two 
independent translators. The Arabic version was validated by inviting 90 
patients who underwent RC and ONB and 72 normal individuals to complete the 
questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire was tested for internal 
consistency using the Cronbach's α test. Inter-domain association was tested by 
Spearman's correlation coefficient. The discrimination validity was measured by 
comparing the scores in RC patients and in normal individuals using the 
Mann-Whitney U-test and independent sample t-test.
RESULTS: Internal consistency was high for all domains. There was high 
correlation between all domains. This high internal consistency and good 
correlation was maintained when assessment included patients with <7.5 and those 
with ≥7.5 years follow-up. Discrimination validation was confirmed by the 
statistically significant lower scores of all domains in the studied patients in 
comparison to the controls.
CONCLUSION: The Arabic version of the FACT-Bl is a reliable and validated 
instrument that can be used to evaluate health-related quality of life in 
patients after RC and ONB.

We report a case of a 65-year-old patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer 
that was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radical 
cystoprostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and orthotopic neobladder 
according to Hautmann. Nine years later, routine follow-up showed local 
recurrence in the neobladder and metastatic disease of the urothelial carcinoma 
in the related mesenteric lymph nodes. The entire neobladder specimen was 
removed including the mesentery of the neobladder. Based on the anatomical lymph 
drainage of the ileal neobladder, we considered the metastatic disease in the 
mesentery lymph node as locoregional disease spread. This case shows that such 
locoregional lymph node metastasis may be amenable to treatment by induction 
chemotherapy and radical surgery.

PURPOSE: To classify patients with orthotopic neobladder based on urodynamic 
parameters using cluster analysis and to characterize the voiding function of 
each group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2012 to November 2015, 142 patients with 
bladder cancer underwent radical cystectomy and Studer neobladder reconstruction 
at our institute. Of the 142 patients, 103 with complete urodynamic data and 
information on urinary functional outcomes were included in this study. K-means 
clustering was performed with urodynamic parameters which included maximal 
cystometric capacity, residual volume, maximal flow rate, compliance, and 
detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate. Three groups emerged by cluster 
analysis. Urodynamic parameters and urinary function outcomes were compared 
between three groups.
RESULTS: Group 1 (n = 44) had ideal urodynamic parameters with a mean maximal 
bladder capacity of 513.3 ml and mean residual urine volume of 33.1 ml. Group 2 
(n = 42) was characterized by small bladder capacity with low compliance. 
Patients in group 2 had higher rates of daytime incontinence and nighttime 
incontinence than patients in group 1. Group 3 (n = 17) was characterized by 
large residual urine volume with high compliance. When we examined gender 
differences in urodynamics and functional outcomes, residual urine volume and 
the rate of daytime incontinence were only marginally significant. However, 
females were significantly more likely to belong to group 2 or 3 (P = 0.003). In 
multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with group 1 which has the 
most ideal urodynamic pattern, age (OR 0.95, P = 0.017) and male gender (OR 
7.57, P = 0.003) were identified as significant factors.
CONCLUSIONS: While patients with ileal neobladder present with various voiding 
symptoms, three urodynamic patterns were identified by cluster analysis. 
Approximately half of patients had ideal urodynamic parameters. The other two 
groups were characterized by large residual urine and small capacity bladder 
with low compliance. Young age and male gender appear to have a favorable impact 
on urodynamic and voiding outcomes in patients undergoing orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of the American College of Surgeons National 
Surgical Quality Improvement Programs (ACS-NSQIP) surgical risk calculator in 
patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary diversion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative characteristics of patients who underwent RC 
with ileal conduit or orthotropic neobladder (ONB) between 2007 and 2016 were 
entered into the proprietary online ACS-NSQIP calculator to generate 30-day 
predicted risk profiles. Predicted and observed outcomes were compared by 
measuring Brier score (BS) and area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Of 954 patients undergoing RC, 609 (64%) received ileal conduit and 345 
(36%) received ONB. The calculator underestimated most risks by 10%-81%. The BSs 
exceeded the acceptable threshold of 0.01 and AUC were less than 0.8 for all 
outcomes in the overall cohort. The mean (standard deviation) predicted vs. 
observed length of stay was 9 (1.5) vs. 10.6 (7.4) days (Pearson's r = 0.09). 
Among patients who received ONB, adequate BS (<0.01) was observed for pneumonia, 
cardiac complications, and death. The receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis revealed moderate accuracy of calculator for cardiac complications (AUC 
= 0.69) and discharge to rehab center (AUC = 0.75) among patients who underwent 
RC with ONB.
CONCLUSIONS: The universal ACS-NSQIP calculator poorly predicts most 
postoperative complications among patients undergoing RC with urinary diversion. 
A procedure-specific risk calculator is required to better counsel patients in 
the preoperative setting and generate realistic quality measures.

INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide. The most 
common treatment for invasive cancer is radical cystectomy and urinary diversion 
(ileal conduit, continent urinary reservoir, orthotopic neobladder). In elderly 
patients, the standards methods of urinary diversion have been the ileal conduit 
and ureterocutaneostomy. Quality of life is an important consideration for 
patients with urinary diversion.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to review the literature on 
quality of life in elderly patients with bladder cancer following a cystectomy 
and urinary diversion.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A literature review was conducted using the electronic 
databases PubMed and Google scholar covering the period of time from 2006 to 
2016. The following key words were entered: "quality of life", "bladder cancer", 
"elderly" "cystectomy" and a combination thereof. The exclusion criteria for the 
articles were languages other than English.
RESULTS: It was found that various questionnaires were used. Some instruments 
measure QoL in general, whereas others are more specific with respect to the 
unique ways in which urinary diversion can impact patients' lives. Furthermore, 
some findings are contradictory, with certain results indicating that there is 
no statistically significant difference between quality of life parameters when 
comparing patients with a neobladder to those with an ileal conduit. In another 
study, patients who underwent orthotopic neobladder reconstruction reported 
significantly better physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning 
and QoL in general throughout the first postoperative months compared to 
patients who had ileal conduit formation.
CONCLUSIONS: All types of treatment have a number of advantages and 
disadvantages, the details of which should be explained to elderly patients 
thoroughly. This calls for comprehensive counseling sessions during which the 
patient and health professional discuss all relevant considerations.

Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France.

OBJECTIVES: To report the long-term survival of transplanted kidneys in patients 
with a continent urinary diversion.
METHODS: Between January 1987 and July 2015, 16 patients with a median age of 37 
years (range 21-63 years) underwent kidney transplantation on a continent 
urinary diversion. A total of 14 patients presented irreversible dysfunction of 
the lower urinary tract, and two patients had required radical cystectomy 
because of bladder cancer. All continent urinary diversions were carried out 
before the transplantation. There were nine Kock pouches, five Mainz pouches, 
one Mainz neobladder and one Hautmann neobladder. A total of 11 patients had a 
previous non-continent urinary diversion. Of the transplants, 14 came from 
brain-dead donors and two from related living donors.
RESULTS: The median post-transplantation follow up was 171 months (range 30-298 
months). Two patients died, while six patients lost their transplant and resumed 
hemodialysis. Nine patients (56.2%) were alive with a functional transplant at 
the end of follow up. The most common allograft complication was acute 
pyelonephritis, but no graft was lost as a result of urinary diversion 
complications. The kidney transplant survival rate was 73.3% after 10 years, and 
66.6% after 15 years. Among patients who still had a functional transplant at 
the time of the study, creatinine clearance was >30 mL/min for seven patients 
and <30 mL/min for two patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the longest series to date of renal 
transplantation on continent urinary diversions. The long-term outcome shows 
that the presence of a continent urinary diversion does not reduce transplant 
survival.

PURPOSE: Fistula formation is a rare and poorly described complication following 
radical cystectomy with urinary diversion. We sought to identify patients who 
experienced any type of fistulous complication and we analyzed risk factors for 
formation as well as management outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at our institution. Patients who 
experienced any fistula were identified. Risk factors, management strategies and 
outcomes were analyzed. Patients underwent initial conservative treatment and 
those in whom this treatment failed underwent surgical repair. Univariable and 
multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of fistula 
formation as well as the need for surgical repair.
RESULTS: Of the 1,041 patients 31 (3.0%) experienced fistula formation. Median 
time to fistula presentation was 31 days. Enterodiversion was the most common 
fistula type, noted in 54.8% of patients, followed by enterocutaneous and 
diversion cutaneous treatment in 29.0% and 12.9%, respectively. On multivariable 
analyses a history of radiation therapy (OR 3.1, p = 0.03) and an orthotopic 
neobladder (OR 3.1, p = 0.04) were predictors of fistula formation. Conservative 
management was successful in 41.9% of cases. There were no predictors of failed 
conservative management. Of patients who required surgical repair success was 
achieved in 94.4% at a single operation.
CONCLUSIONS: Fistulas are rare after radical cystectomy and they are most common 
between the urinary diversion and the small bowel. A history of radiation 
therapy and a orthotopic neobladder are risk factors for formation. When 
required, surgical repair is generally successful at a single operation.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract obstruction and postoperative hydronephrosis are risk 
factor for renal function deterioration after orthotopic ileal neobladder 
construction. However, reports of relationship between transient hydronephrosis 
and renal function are limited. We assess the influence of postoperative 
transient hydronephrosis on renal function in patients with orthotopic ileal 
neobladder construction.
METHODS: Between January 2006 and June 2013, we performed radical cystectomy in 
164 patients, and 101 received orthotopic ileal neobladder construction. This 
study included data available from 64 patients with 128 renal units who were 
enrolled retrospectively. The hydronephrosis grade of each renal unit scored 
0-4. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the grade of 
hydronephrosis: control, low, intermediate, and high. The grade of postoperative 
hydronephrosis was compared with renal function 1 month and 1 year after 
surgery.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in renal function before surgery 
between groups. One month after surgery, the presence of hydronephrosis was 
significantly associated with decreased renal function. However, 1 year after 
urinary diversion hydronephrosis grades were improved significantly, and renal 
function was comparable between groups. Postoperative hydronephrosis at 1 month 
had no significant influence on renal function 1 year after ileal neobladder 
construction. Limitations include retrospective design, short follow-up periods, 
and a sample composition.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of transient hydronephrosis immediately after surgery 
may have limited influence on renal function 1 year after ileal neobladder 
construction.

There are numerous options for forming an orthotopic bladder by the source 
tissue and the shape of the urinary reservoir. In our practice, we use the 
technique reported by Karolinska Institute (Sweden). This technique allows us to 
form a neobladder most resembling the natural urinary bladder in the shape and 
volume. The article presents a clinical observation describing this technique in 
a 63 year old patient who was initially diagnosed with bladder cancer pT2N0M0G3 
and underwent transurethral resection of the bladder wall with the tumor. 
Thereafter, the patient underwent laparoscopic cystoprostatvesicleectomy with 
extended pelvic lymph node dissection and orthotopic ileal bladder substitution. 
His upper urinary tract on both sides was drained by ureteral stents with 
external diversion. The eccentric suturing technique makes it possible to form 
an oval-shaped urinary reservoir that is anatomically and functionally most 
comparable to a healthy man's bladder.

PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term cumulative incidence of chronic urinary 
retention (CUR) after radical cystectomy (RC) and orthotopic neobladder (ONB) in 
women and the possible risk factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively evaluated 
cohort of women for whom RC and ONB were performed. Patients in CUR were 
evaluated for the cumulative incidence of CUR using Kaplan-Meier curve and for 
the possible risk factors using log rank and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 234 women with mean age ± SD of 52.3 ± 9 years and a median 
(range) of follow-up of 92 (12-247) months were included. The incidence of CUR 
increased with time, where 12 (5.2%), 21 (8.97%), 35 (14.9%), 53 (22.6%), and 56 
(24%) patients started clean intermittent catheterization in 1, 2, 2 to 5 years, 
5 to 10 years, and after 10 years of follow-up, respectively. In univariate and 
multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus and urethral Kock pouch were 
independent predictors of CUR development (HR [95% CI] = 2.45 [1.2-5.1], and 2.1 
[1.05-4.2], P = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Genital- sparing RC and surgical 
modification to provide pouch back support were independent factors that reduce 
CUR development (HR [95% CI] = 9.3 [1.25-69.9], and 2.1 [1.19-3.9], P = 0.02 and 
0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of CUR after RC and ONB in women increases with time 
even after 10 years of follow-up. Presence of diabetes mellitus increases the 
risk of CUR development. Genital-sparing RC and modification to prevent CUR 
reduced the likelihood of CUR development.

Robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with urinary diversion is commonly 
performed in community hospitals. While little data exist on RARC outcomes in 
this setting, community hospitals may improve access to care for bladder cancer 
patients. We conducted a retrospective review of 76 patients who underwent RARC 
between 2006 and 2016 by two robotic-trained surgeons in two local community 
hospitals. A total of 76 patients (60 males and 16 females; ages 46-89) 
underwent RARC with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion (69 
ileal conduits, 7 neobladders) for muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (79%), 
recurrent high-grade carcinoma (17%), unresectable tumor (2%), or refractory 
gross hematuria from chemotherapy (2%). Median-estimated surgical blood loss 
(EBL) was 400 mL, and median operating time was 386 min. Transfusion rate was 
22% and median length of hospital stay was 6 days. Our 90-day complication rate 
was 47%, with no mortalities in the 90-day post-operative period. The majority 
of complications (58%) were Clavien grade 1-2. We observed a significant 
difference in incidence of complications among patients receiving neobladder vs. 
ileal conduit (p = 0.002). On pathology, zero patients had positive bladder 
specimen margins. Among 28 patients with at least 3-year follow-up, overall 
survival was 85.7%, and among 9 patients with at least 5-year follow-up, overall 
survival was 100%. Contrary to some studies, our findings suggest similar 
short-term surgical and pathologic outcomes for RARC performed in the community 
hospital setting compared to high volume centers. We defined several criteria 
for low volume centers to effectively and safely perform RARC.

BACKGROUND: To identify symptom distress and clusters in patients 3 months after 
radical cystectomy and to explore their potential predictors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate 99 bladder cancer 
patients 3 months after radical cystectomy. Data were collected by demographic 
and disease characteristic questionnaires, the symptom experience scale of the 
M.D. Anderson symptom inventory, two additional symptoms specific to radical 
cystectomy, and the functional assessment of cancer therapy questionnaire. A 
factor analysis, stepwise regression, and correlation analysis were applied.
RESULTS: Three symptom clusters were identified: fatigue-malaise, 
gastrointestinal, and psycho-urinary. Age, complication severity, albumin 
post-surgery (negative), orthotropic neobladder reconstruction, adjuvant 
chemotherapy and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were 
significant predictors of fatigue-malaise. Adjuvant chemotherapy, orthotropic 
neobladder reconstruction, female gender, ASA scores and albumin (negative) were 
significant predictors of gastrointestinal symptoms. Being unmarried, having a 
higher educational level and complication severity were significant predictors 
of psycho-urinary symptoms. The correlations between clusters and for each 
cluster with quality of life were significant, with the highest correlation 
observed between the psycho-urinary cluster and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Bladder cancer patients experience concurrent symptoms that appear 
to cluster and are significantly correlated with quality of life. Moreover, 
symptom clusters may be predicted by certain demographic and clinical 
characteristics.

BACKGROUND: The development of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols 
for patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) represents a significant advance 
in perioperative care.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) complications following RC and 
urinary diversion (UD) using our institutional ERAS protocol.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified 377 consecutive cases of open 
RC and UD for which our ERAS protocol was used from May 2012 to December 2015. 
Exclusion criteria were consent refusal; non-bladder primary disease; 
palliative, salvage, or additional surgery; and prolonged postoperative 
intubation. A matched cohort of 144 patients for whom a traditional 
postoperative protocol (pre-ERAS) was used between 2003 and 2012 was selected 
for comparison.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 292 ERAS patients with median age of 70 yr 
were included in the study, 65% of whom received an orthotopic neobladder. The 
median time to first flatus and bowel movement was 2 d. The median length of 
stay was 4 d. GI complications occurred in 45 patients (15.4%) during the first 
30 d following RC, 93% of which were of minor grade. The most common GI 
complication was postoperative ileus (POI) in 34 cases (11.6%). Some 22 patients 
(7.5%) required a nasogastric tube, and parenteral nutrition was required in 
three patients. The rate of 30-d GI complications was significantly lower in the 
ERAS cohort than in the control group (13% vs 27%; p=0.003), as was the rate of 
POI (7% vs 23%; p<0.001). This effect was independent of other variables (hazard 
ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.82; p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our institutional ERAS protocol for RC is associated with 
significantly improved perioperative GI recovery and lower rates of GI 
complications. This protocol can be tested in multi-institutional studies to 
reduce GI morbidity associated with RC.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we showed that an enhanced recovery protocol for 
patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer was associated with a 
significantly shorter length of hospital stay and lower rates of 
gastrointestinal complications, especially postoperative ileus.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes of robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC) combined with 
perioperative chemotherapy for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate surgical and oncological outcomes for RARC and ORC in 
multimodal treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from 28 centres were collected for 
cystectomies performed between January 2000 and July 2013.
INTERVENTION: RARC or ORC combined with perioperative chemotherapy for UBC.
OUTCOME MEASURES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Fisher's exact tests, χ2 tests, and 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the RARC and ORC groups. Logistic 
and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential prognostic 
factors.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 688 patients (n=603 ORC and n=85 RARC) were 
analysed; 60.6% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 45.1% adjuvant 
chemotherapy. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found 
between the groups. The median time from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy was 
1.9 mo for both RARC and ORC groups. The median number of lymph nodes removed 
was 21 (interquartile range [IQR] 14-35) for RARC and 13 (IQR 8-21) for ORC 
(p<0.001); the results were confirmed in subgroup analyses. Multivariable 
analyses revealed no difference in the rate of positive surgical margins (p=0.54 
and p=0.78), rate of neobladder diversion (p=0.33 and p=0.51), relapse-free 
survival (p=0.31 and p=0.23), and overall survival (p=0.63 and p=0.69). The 
retrospective nature of the data is the major limitation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no differences in efficacy outcomes or ability to 
deliver adjuvant chemotherapy were observed between RARC and ORC. The increasing 
use of RARC is justifiable from an oncological viewpoint.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In a retrospective study of patients who received perioperative 
chemotherapy for urothelial bladder cancer, we found no difference in key 
outcomes between robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and open radical 
cystectomy. Performing RARC seems to be justifiable in the multidisciplinary 
setting.

BACKGROUND: The prayer ritual is an essential component of Islam that requires 
entry into a state of physical purity (wudhu) through ablution, which is 
invalidated by voiding. An important dilemma for patients and surgeons may arise 
when a Muslim patient is counselled on cystectomy because of the belief by some 
that an incontinent urinary diversion will automatically invalidate their wudhu.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if there are any religious barriers and implications for 
Muslim patients undergoing an incontinent urinary diversion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A questionnaire was distributed to all UK 
mosques, addressed to the imam (n=804).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 134 imams (response rate 16.7%) responded. 
There was general agreement among imams, with >90% answering that it is possible 
for a Muslim to perform ablution, pray, and enter a mosque with a urinary stoma. 
The majority of imams (86.6%) also stated that refusal of a urinary stoma was 
not justified by religious teachings. When asked if patients should choose the 
option of a neobladder despite this surgery having greater risk, 57.5% of 
respondents stated that they were either unsure or agreed with this alternative.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of imams agreed that Muslims with a urinary stoma are 
able to maintain their ablution, allowing them to conduct their daily prayers, 
and that this form of surgery should not be refused on religious grounds. Our 
study suggests that the consensus view is that a urinary stoma is not 
contraindicated with regard to the practice of Islamic prayer rituals.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study we investigated if having a urinary stoma would 
be a religious barrier for Muslim patients in performing their obligatory prayer 
rituals. The overwhelming majority of imams stated that having a urinary stoma 
should not stop Muslim patients practising important aspects of their faith.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical technique and report early outcomes of 
transurethral assisted laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) radical prostatectomy 
(RP) and LESS radical cystectomy (RC) in a single institution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2014 and March 2016, a total of 114 LESS 
RPs and RCs were performed, comprising 68 LESS RPs, 38 LESS RCs with cutaneous 
ureterostomy (CU) and eight LESS RCs with orthotopic ileal neobladder (OIN). 
Access was achieved via a single-port, with four channels placed through a 
transumblical incision. After the apex of prostate was separated from the 
urethra, a self-developed port ('Zhu's port') was inserted through the urethra 
to facilitate resection of prostate and urethrovesical anastomosis. The 
peri-operative and postoperative data were collected and analysed 
retrospectively. Patients were followed up postoperatively for evidence of 
long-term side effects.
RESULTS: All the procedures were completed successfully. No conversion to 
conventional laparoscopic surgery was necessary. For LESS RP, the average 
operating time was 152 min. Estimated blood loss was 117 mL. The mean hospital 
stay was 16.4 days after surgery. For LESS RC with CU and LESS RC with OIN, the 
mean operating times were 215 and 328 min, mean estimated blood loss was 175 and 
252 mL, and mean hospital stay was 9.4 and 18.2 days, respectively. Six patients 
required blood transfusion (5.26%). Intra-operative complications occurred in 
two patients (1.75%), and postoperative complications in nine (7.89%). Fourteen 
out of 68 (20.6%) patients who underwent LESS RP had positive surgical margins. 
Follow-up ranged from 10 to 30.6 months. In the prostate cancer cases, good 
urinary control was observed in 35.3%, 97.1% and 100% of patients at 1, 6 and 
12 months after the operation, respectively, while biochemical recurrence was 
observed in 11.8% patients. In the bladder cancer cases, two patients had local 
recurrence and two patients had distant metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that LESS RP and LESS RC are feasible and safe 
with the aid of a transurethral port. Operating through the transurethral port 
might overcome the challenges posed by the single-port laparoscopic approach.

CONTEXT: Gender-specific functional and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
outcomes following radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer (BCa) remain 
unclear, with many studies excluding women from the study population.
OBJECTIVE: To better characterize female-specific functional outcomes following 
RC and urinary diversion for BCa.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a critical review of PubMed/Medline and 
Embase in August 2015 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-analysis statement. Outcomes of interest included urinary 
function (for orthotopic neobladder), sexual function, bowel function, and 
quality of life. Excluded were nonbladder malignancies, RCs performed for 
neurogenic bladder dysfunction, and patients with exposure to radiation therapy 
prior to surgery. Forty-five publications were selected for inclusion in this 
analysis.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Included reports addressed urinary function (34 studies), 
sexual function (11 studies), and HRQOL (9 studies). All studies had a high risk 
of bias and ranged significantly in sample size, inclusion criteria, and 
follow-up time, precluding meaningful meta-analysis. Daytime incontinence 
approximated 20%, nighttime incontinence 20%, and hypercontinence 10-20%. Sexual 
function appeared to be better among those patients undergoing genitalia-sparing 
RC, but generally poor outcomes were noted among those undergoing routine RC. 
Only 40% of studies assessed sexual function using standardized instruments. 
HRQOL differences between diversion types appeared to be minimal, whereas 
comparisons with the general population revealed significant differences in 
emotional problems, role functioning, fatigue, and appetite.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional outcomes among women undergoing RC for BCa are poorly 
studied with limitations regarding use of validated questionnaires, 
heterogeneous patient populations, and small sample sizes. Collaborative efforts 
will be needed to better define functional outcomes among this poorly studied 
patient population.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed functional outcomes following cystectomy among 
women with bladder cancer. We found that urinary, sexual, and bowel function and 
quality of life are poorly studied among women, with function ranging 
significantly across studies.

INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary 
diversion are faced with difficult decisions regarding mode of urinary 
diversion. Although these patients may use the Internet as a guide to diagnosis 
and treatment options, online resources remain largely unregulated leading to a 
great variation in quality of medical information. Further variation in quality 
is seen between languages. Fortunately, tools such as an automated toolbar 
developed by the World Health Organization Health on the Net (HON) Foundation 
exist to assist physicians in recommending quality online health information to 
patients. We set out to compare and assess the quality of bladder cancer, ileal 
conduit and orthotopic neobladder web sites in 2016 on the basis of the HON 
principles for English language.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Google search engine imbedded with the HON toolbar was 
used to assess 1350 Web sites using the keywords "bladder cancer", "ileal 
conduit" and "orthotopic neobladder" in English, Italian and Spanish. The first 
150 results of each search were identified and screened. A further analysis was 
completed comparing results between 2009 and 2016.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Less than 20% of English, Italian and Spanish "bladder 
cancer" and urinary diversion ("ileal conduit" and "orthotopic neobladder") web 
sites are HON-accredited. HON-accredited web sites featured preferentially in 
the first 50 search results for bladder cancer (P=0.0001) and ileal conduit 
(P=0.03) web sites. Comparing 2016 results to 2009, percentage of 
HON-accreditation has not shown statistically significant change (-13%, P=0.23), 
while overall number of search results has increased (+44%).
CONCLUSIONS: A lack of validation of bladder cancer sites is present, which is 
consistent across modes of urinary diversion (orthotopic neobladder and ileal 
conduit) and languages. It is important that physicians involved in the care of 
bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion 
participate in the development of informative, ethical, and reliable health Web 
sites and direct patients to them.

OBJECTIVE: To compare 2 bladder cancer-specific health-related quality of life 
instruments (HRQOL) in the same patient population. Previous HRQOL studies in 
cystectomy patients have yielded conflicting results. Using a cross-sectional 
study design, we examined the only 2 validated bladder cancer-specific (HRQOL) 
measures.
METHODS: Of the 256 patients who had undergone radical cystectomy from 2009 to 
2014, 131 met both inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Functional Assessment 
Cancer Therapy-Vanderbilt Cystectomy Index (FACT-VCI) and Bladder Cancer Index 
(BCI) were mailed to these patients. Overall HRQOL and individual domain scores 
were compared between the 2 instruments with a Spearman correlation coefficient. 
HRQOL scores were compared by urinary diversion type as well using a 
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test.
RESULTS: Our study had a response rate of 49% from 31 ileal conduit (IC) and 33 
orthotopic neobladder patients. Overall, there was a moderate correlation 
between the FACT-VCI and BCI surveys (r = 0.57, P <.001). Responses on the BCI 
domains were strongly correlated with responses on the bladder cancer-specific 
domain of the FACT-VCI (r = 0.74, P <.001). The BCI scores for urinary function 
were significantly better in the IC group (P = .002). No significant difference 
was found between IC and orthotopic neobladder using the FACT-VCI.
CONCLUSION: The FACT-VCI and BCI instruments correlate well within the same 
patient cohort but capture different aspects of HRQOL. By focusing exclusively 
on bladder cancer treatment concerns, the BCI appears to be a better tool for 
assessing and counseling patients on expected treatment-specific changes after 
diversion type.

After radical cystectomy or pathologies affecting the ureter(s), bowel segments 
can be employed to restore the natural urine flow or to create an external 
urinary diversion. Nevertheless, the interposition of bowel segments in the 
urinary tract is not devoid of complications. In fact, bowel's microstructure 
differs from the urothelium; specifically its mucosa is aimed at reabsorption, 
rather than storage. The aim of this paper is to revise the pathophysiology of 
complications related to bowel's mucosal properties. Those are: metabolic 
imbalance, malabsorption of vitamins, cholelitiasis, nephrolitiasis and 
infections. Their entity varies according to the segment used and to its length, 
which reflects the surface in contact with urine. Mostly, they occur on the 
long-term, but metabolic imbalances might occur soon after surgery as well.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is an aggressive disease associated with high 
morbidity and mortality. Radical cystectomy is the mainstay of treatment and has 
evolved since the first reported cystectomy in 1887 to include pelvic lymph node 
dissection and the creation of increasingly sophisticated urinary diversions, 
such as neobladders and pouches, which enable patients to maintain continence. 
Pioneering work in the 1970s established the therapeutic activity of cisplatin 
in patients with bladder cancer and resulted in the introduction of 
cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which led to the first improvement in 
survival outcomes in decades. Other notable advances include the development of 
bladder-sparing protocols, which combine surgery, chemotherapy, and 
radiotherapy. Molecular profiling of bladder cancer has helped to enhance our 
understanding of tumour biology and identify several therapeutic targets, such 
as programmed death (PD-1) and its ligand programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1). Over the past 3 years, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the 
PD-1-PD-L1 axis have demonstrated the ability to achieve durable objective 
responses in trials of patients with metastatic disease. If the current momentum 
continues, immunotherapy is poised to change the landscape of muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer treatment, promising improved survival outcomes for patients with 
this disease.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the different and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) 
outcomes between ileal conduit (IC) and ileal orthotopic neobladder (IONB) in 
patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC), by using validated self-reported 
cancer-specific instruments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, multicenter cohort 
study included 148 and 171 patients with either IC or IONB. HR-QoL was evaluated 
with Quality of Life Core Questionnaire and bladder module (BLM)-30 European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires. Baseline 
HR-QoL scores were dichotomized at the median to give "good" or "poor" score 
profiles. A matched-pair analysis compared HR-QoL aspects between 79 IC patients 
and 79 IONB patients.
RESULTS: At univariate analysis IONB resulted favorable for physical 
functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning (CF), fatigue, 
dyspnea, appetite loss, constipation (CO), and abdominal bloating flatulence 
(AB). At multivariate analyses, IONB showed better scores for emotional 
functioning (85 vs 79, P = .023), CF (93 vs 85, P <.001), CO (16 vs 31, 
P <.001), and AB (12 vs 25, P <.001). A significant worsening of sexual and 
urinary function was observed for IONB patients in the long-term. At 
matched-pair analysis, global health status was similar (65 vs 62, P = .385). 
Significantly better scores were observed in the IONB group for the following 
items: CF (P = .007), fatigue (P = .003), pain (P = .019), dyspnea (P = .016), 
CO (P = .001), and AB (P = .00).
CONCLUSION: IONB and IC after RC were similar in terms of global health status. 
IONB provides better results in some aspects of HR-QoL related to bowel 
function, but a worsening of urinary and sexual functions. Further randomized 
controlled trials are needed to confirm these data.

University , Assiut , Egypt.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the functional outcome after 
endoscopic management of neobladder complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of 197 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and 
orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction between 2007 and 2013, 30 patients 
with delayed postoperative complications were enrolled in this study. 
Complications were in the form of: eight patients with outflow obstruction, 12 
with ureteroenteric stricture, nine with neobladder calculi and one with an 
isolated recurrent papillary tumor inside the neobladder. Patients were followed 
up regularly to assess the outcomes of endoscopic treatment.
RESULTS: The mean maximum flow rate and postvoiding residual urine after 
endoscopic treatment of outflow obstruction were 18.2 ± 3.9 ml/s and 
28.7 ± 11 ml, respectively. Ten patients with ureteroenteric stricture showed 
resolution of hydronephrosis after antegrade dilatation and JJ-stent fixation, 
with two patients requiring open surgery owing to impassable strictures. 
Complete clearance of neobladder calculi occurred after endoscopic 
neocystolithotripsy, with two patients requiring two sessions owing to large 
calculi. Transurethral resection of the neobladder for isolated tumor recurrence 
was performed in one patient over two sessions, followed by adjuvant 
chemoirradiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Endourological management of orthotopic neobladder problems is the 
safest choice. It avoids the difficulties and complications of open surgery and 
has durable results.

OBJECTIVES: To compare health-related quality of life and oncological and 
functional outcomes on erectile function, continence, and voiding function among 
bladder patients who underwent orthotopic neobladder reconstruction after 
prostate-sparing cystectomy (PSC) and conventional radical cystoprostatectomy 
(CRC).
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from a single surgeon. During 2007 
to 2015, we identified 25 of 186 male patients receiving radical cystectomies 
due to bladder cancer who underwent orthotopic neobladder reconstruction, 14 
patients with PSC and the other 11 patients with CRC. International Index of 
Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-Core 30-item questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), and 
self-catheterizations were used to evaluate functional outcomes in the baseline 
and 1 year after operation.
RESULTS: There were better physical and social functioning scales, less fatigue 
symptoms, better IIEF (16 versus 3.7, p = 0.01), and less self-catheterization 
rate (33% versus 89%  p = 0.006) in the PSC group. The oncologic outcomes were 
the same between two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: For selected patients with bladder cancer who underwent neobladder 
reconstruction, prostate-sparing cystectomy provided better sexuality 
preservation, less daily self-catheterization, and better physical function and 
social function scales without compromising overall survival.

BACKGROUND: The present retrospective study analyzed the tolerance of orthotopic 
ileal neobladders to radiotherapy by reviewing the acute and late toxicity in 
patients who underwent postoperative radiotherapy after radical 
cystectomy/cystoprostatectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional database was created for patients 
who had undergone radical cystectomy/cystoprostatectomy and neobladder 
reconstruction, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). The patient and tumor 
characteristics were recorded. The RT data were reviewed to determine the 
treatment technique used, the radiation dose received by the neobladder, and 
acute and late toxicity evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.0, scale.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were included, with a median age of 64 years. Of 
the 25 patients, 18 received a dose of 45 to 50.4 Gy. The most common reasons 
for postoperative radiotherapy were close or positive surgical margins and 
pT3-pT4 or N+ disease. Ten patients underwent intensity modulated RT. All but 1 
patient completed the RT course. Of the patients who completed their RT 
schedule, none had grade ≥ 3 acute gastrointestinal toxicity. One patient who 
received concurrent chemotherapy developed grade 3 acute genitourinary toxicity. 
Three patients reported late grade 1 genitourinary toxicity (frequency of 
urination, mild leakage at night), with no reports of chronic gastrointestinal 
toxicity. None of the patients experienced neobladder perforation, leak, or 
fistula.
CONCLUSION: The use of moderate doses of pelvic RT (range, 45-50.4 Gy) was well 
tolerated among the 25 patients who underwent RT after cystoprostatectomy with 
orthotopic neobladder creation. This finding supports the use of postoperative 
RT to moderate doses in this patient population when clinically indicated.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on peri-operative 
and oncological outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with 
intracorporeal urinary diversion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 216 patients undergoing RARC, extended 
lymphadenectomy and intracorporeal urinary diversion, between July 2010 and 
December 2015, were categorized into four BMI groups according to the 2004 World 
Health Organization obesity classification groups: <25 kg/m2 (normal); 25-29.9 
kg/m2 (pre-obese); 30-34.9 kg/m2 (obese class I); and ≥35 kg/m2 (obese class 
II). Pre-, intra- and postoperative characteristics, oncological outcomes, and 
90-day complications were compared using sas statistical software.
RESULTS: All 216 patients underwent intracorporeal urinary diversion, with 68 
(32%) undergoing orthotopic neobladder construction. Demographics were similar 
among the BMI groups with regard to median (range) age (71.8 [35- 95] years), 
gender (80.6% men), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score (66.2% with CCI score 
0-1), pathological stage (carcinoma in situ to T2: 55.1%, T3-T4/N0: 18.5%, 
Tx/N+: 26.4%), median (interquartile range) node count [41 (28, 53)] and 
positive soft tissue margin rate (4.2%). Obese patients had greater blood loss 
and longer operating time (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively). There were no 
significant differences in length of hospital stay, transfusion rates, 
readmission or 90-day overall and high-grade complication rates (P = 0.16, P = 
0.96, P = 0.89, P = 0.22 and P = 0.51, respectively). At a median (range) 
follow-up of 13 months (15 days to 4.8 years), recurrence-free survival (P = 
0.92) and overall survival (P = 0.68) were similar among the groups.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that RARC with intracorporeal 
urinary diversion is safe and feasible in obese patients with bladder cancer. 
BMI was not associated with significant differences in peri-operative, 
pathological or early oncological outcomes.

[Ureterointestinal anastomosis in urinary diversion - current opinion].

[Article in Czech]

Doležel J.

Uretero-intestinal anastomosis (UIA) is one of the most critical points for the 
occurrence of severe complications of intestinal urinary diversion. Perfection 
of the current techniques and development of new UIA methods are motivated by 
the effort to reduce both early and late post-surgical complications. The 
necessity of using antireflux UIA, especially with an orthotopic neobladder, is 
controversial: according to some authors, antireflux UIA of any type generally 
increases, in comparison with reflux UIA, the risk of obstruction that endangers 
renal function more than the urine reflux itself. ICUD-EAU International 
Consultation on Bladder Cancer 2012 does not recommend applying antireflux UIA 
in orthotopic bladder substitutions. In ileal conduit diversions, most surgeons 
use only refluxing UIA. Studer and Turner recommend antireflux UIA only in cases 
where urine diversion can generate great intraluminal pressure and/or where 
there is a high risk of permanent bacterial colonization. The flap-and-trough 
technique (FT) of nonrefluxing UIA represents another flap-valve method for 
implanting normal as well as dilated ureters into various types of urinary 
diversion, with a low risk of stenotic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple refluxing end-to-side UIA to a low-pressure orthotopic 
reservoir is a procedure of choice with low complication rates. On the other 
hand, the need for reflux prevention with a conduit, continent cutaneous 
diversion or anal diversion is well-founded.Key words: ureterointestinal 
anastomosis.

PURPOSE: We evaluated preoperative ureteral obstruction as a risk factor for 
benign ureteroenteric anastomosis strictures in patients who underwent open 
radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder diversion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 953 patients in whom bilateral 
ileoureterostomy was performed between January 1986 and March 2009 formed the 
study population. A nonrefluxing Le Duc technique was applied in 357 consecutive 
patients and a refluxing Wallace type technique was applied in 596. We defined 
ureteroenteric anastomosis stricture as the need for specific therapy (eg 
stenting, dilatation or reimplantation) or as proven loss of renal function. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis was done to calculate the likelihood of ureteroenteric 
anastomosis stricture development.
RESULTS: Median followup in the study population was 65 months. Preoperatively 
109 patients had unilateral or bilateral obstructed ureters. Unilateral or 
bilateral obstruction developed in 107 of the 953 patients (127 reno-ureteral 
units, including 63 on the right side and 64 on the left side). Of the 
reno-ureteral units 98 had benign and 29 had malignant ureteroenteric 
anastomosis strictures. The overall stricture rate due to any cause in 
preoperatively obstructed ureters was 19.3% at 10 years vs 6.4% in 
preoperatively undilated ureters. For the refluxing Wallace type technique the 
10-year ureteroenteric anastomosis stricture rate was 2.4% for preoperatively 
undilated and 7.6% for preoperatively obstructed ureters. For the nonrefluxing 
technique the corresponding rates at 10 years were 14.2% and 35.54%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively obstructed ureters are at significantly higher risk 
for benign ureteroenteric anastomosis strictures during the postoperative course 
after ileal neobladder diversion. Most such Le Duc strictures are bilateral and 
most such Wallace type strictures are unilateral. The risk of ureteroenteric 
anastomosis stricture after ureteroenterostomy using the nonrefluxing technique 
is threefold the risk of the refluxing technique. There was no preponderance of 
left ureteroenteric anastomosis strictures after each technique.

BACKGROUND: Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy with 
extended pelvic lymph node dissection is considered to be the treatment of 
choice for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Despite this 
aggressive treatment the outcome is poor and ultimately, 30% of the patients 
with ≥pT3 tumors develop a pelvic recurrence. We hypothesize that postoperative 
adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) might prevent local and lymph node 
recurrence and improve disease free- and overall survival as loco-regional 
recurrence is linked to the development of distant metastasis.
METHODS: We plan to perform a multicentric prospective phase two study including 
76 patients. Eligible patients are patients with MIBC, treated with radical 
cystectomy and presenting with ≥1 of the following characteristics: Pathological 
(p)T3 stage + presence of lymphovascular invasion on pathological examination 
pT4 stage <10 lymph nodes removed positive lymph nodes positive surgical margins 
Patients will have a 18F-FDG PET-CT to rule out the presence of distant 
metastasis prior to EBRT. A median dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions is prescribed 
to the pelvic lymph node regions with inclusion of the operative bladder bed in 
case of a positive surgical margin. Patients with suspected lymph nodes on PET- 
CT can still be included in the trial, but a simultaneous integrated boost to 
74Gy to the positive lymph nodes will be delivered. Blood and urine samples will 
be collected on day-1 and last day of EBRT for evaluation of biomarkers. The 
primary endpoint is evaluation of acute ≥Grade 3 intestinal or grade 4 urinary 
toxicity, in case of a neo-bladder reconstruction, within 12 weeks after EBRT. 
Secondary endpoints are: assessment of QOL, late RTOG toxicity, local control, 
disease free survival and overall survival. Biomarkers in urine and blood will 
be correlated with secondary survival endpoints.
DISCUSSION: This is a prospective phase 2 trial re-assessing the feasibility of 
adjuvant radiotherapy in high-risk MIBC.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Ethics committee of the Ghent University Hospital 
(EC2014/0630) approved this study on 31/07/2014. Trial registration on 
Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02397434 ) on November 19, 2014.

INTRODUCTION: To improve care for patients after radical cystoprostatectomy 
(RCP), focus on survivorship issues such as sexual function needs to increase. 
Previous studies have demonstrated the burden of erectile dysfunction (ED) after 
RCP to be as high as 89%.
AIM: To determine the rates of ED treatment use (phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors, injectable therapies, urethral suppositories, vacuum erection 
devices, and penile prosthetics) in patients with bladder cancer before and 
after RCP to better understand current patterns of care.
METHODS: Men with bladder cancer undergoing RCP were identified in the 
MarketScan database (2010-2014). ED treatment use was assessed at baseline 
(during the 1 year before RCP) and at 6-month intervals (0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24 
months) after RCP. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to 
identify predictors of ED treatment use at 6-month intervals after RCP.
OUTCOMES: ED treatment rates and predictors of ED treatment at 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 
19-24 month follow-up after RCP.
RESULTS: At baseline, 6.5% of patients (77 of 1,176) used ED treatments. The 
rates of ED treatment use at 0 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 18, and 19 to 24 months 
after RCP were 15.2%, 12.7%, 8.1%, and 10.1% respectively. Phosphodiesterase 
type 5 inhibitors were the most commonly used treatment at all time points. In 
the multivariable model, predictors of ED treatment use at 0 to 6 months after 
RCP were age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.68-6.01), 
baseline ED treatment use (OR = 5.75, 95% CI = 3.08-10.72), neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.13-2.61), and neobladder diversion (OR = 
2.40, 95% CI = 1.56-3.70). Baseline ED treatment use continued to be associated 
with ED treatment use at 6 to 12 months (OR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.42-13.10) and 13 
to 18 months (OR = 8.99, 95% CI = 3.05-26.51) after RCP.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: While the burden of ED following RCP is known to be high, 
overall ED treatment rates are low. These findings suggest either ED treatment 
is low priority for RCP patients or education about potential ED therapies may 
not be commonly discussed with patients following RCP. Urologists should 
consider discussing sexual function more frequently with their RCP patients.
STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include the use of a national claims 
database, which allows for longitudinal follow-up and detailed information on 
prescription medications and devices. Limitations include the lack of pathologic 
and oncologic outcomes data.
CONCLUSION: ED treatment use after RCP is quite low. The strongest predictor of 
ED treatment use after RCP was baseline treatment use. These findings suggest ED 
treatment is a low priority for patients with RCP or education about potential 
ED therapies might not be commonly discussed with patients after RCP. Urologists 
should consider discussing sexual function more frequently with their patients 
undergoing RCP. Chappadi MR, Kates M, Sopko NA, et al. Erectile Dysfunction

Orthotopic neobladder in patient with locally advanced small cell carcinoma of 
the bladder: a case report and review of the literature.

Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (SCCUB) is a rare, aggressive 
variant of neuroendocrine nonepithelial tumor. The best treatment results are 
achieved by combined cystectomy and chemotherapy. Same as in urothelial bladder 
cancer, a question remains about the urinary diversion in locally advanced 
disease. Studies on surgical treatment of patients with SCCUB most often do not 
clearly specify the type of urinary diversion performed, and we could not find 
information that orthotopic urinary diversion was performed in those patients. 
We present a 58-year-old patient with locally advanced SCCUB, treated by 
cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion (ileal neobladder-Hautmann) followed 
by six-cycle adjuvant chemotherapy. After 50-month follow-up, the patient showed 
no signs of relapse and the new bladder functioned perfectly well.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term (>5 years) health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) outcomes following radical cystectomy, comparing Indiana pouch (IP), 
neobladder (NB), and ileal conduit (IC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The departmental radical cystectomy database was queried 
to identify patients who underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for 
bladder cancer between 1991 and 2009 and had not died. Three hundred patients 
were identified and sent the validated Bladder Cancer Index instrument.
RESULTS: A total of 128 (43%) patients completed the survey. When adjusted for 
gender, age at surgery, surgeon, and time since surgery, IC and IP patients had 
significantly better urinary function than NB patients (P = .0013). Sexual 
bother was less in NB than IP (P = .0387). Among men ≥65 years of age, IC 
patients had significantly better urinary function (P = .0376) than NB patients 
(91.6 vs 49.4, respectively). Among men <65 years of age, IC and IP patients 
(76.0 and 82.8, respectively) had significantly better urinary function than NB 
patients (50.7) (P = .0199). Among women greater than 65 years, bowel bother was 
significantly better (P = .0095) for IC patients than IP patients (44.8 vs 69.5, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Urinary diversion type after radical cystectomy affects HRQOL 
differently in long-term survivors. Age and gender at surgery influenced HRQOL 
based on diversion procedure. Urinary function but not urinary bother was 
significantly better in IC and IP compared to NB diversions. Prospective 
longitudinal studies using validated HRQOL tools will further help guide 
preoperative diversion choice decisions between patient and surgeon.

PURPOSE: Robotic intracorporeal urinary diversion has mostly been done for ileal 
conduit or orthotopic neobladder diversion. We present what is to our knowledge 
the initial series, detailed technique and outcomes of the robotic 
intracorporeal Indiana pouch with a minimum 1-year followup.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy, pelvic 
lymphadenectomy and intracorporeal Indiana pouch urinary diversion for cancer in 
9 and benign disease in 1. Data were collected prospectively. Baseline 
demographics, pathology data, and 1-year complication rates and functional 
outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: All 10 cases were successfully completed intracorporeally without open 
conversion. Median total operative time was 6 hours, including 3.5 hours for 
pouch creation. Median blood loss was 200 cc and median hospital stay was 10 
days. Four Clavien grade 1-2 and 3 Clavien 3-5 complications occurred. None of 
the patients had a bowel leak. One noncompliant patient requested undiversion to 
an ileal conduit. The remaining 9 patients successfully catheterized the ileal 
channel and were completely continent at the last followup at a median of 13.7 
months (range 12.3 to 15.2). Study limitations include small sample size and 
short followup.
CONCLUSIONS: We present what is to our knowledge the initial series of robotic 
completely intracorporeal Indiana pouch diversion. Early perioperative data 
indicate acceptable operative efficiency and complication rates. Longer followup 
is required to assess the functional outcomes of this less commonly performed 
diversion.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional complications after orthotopic neobladder urinary 
diversion (ONB), including urinary incontinence and urinary retention, present 
unique challenges. The purpose of this review is to outline contemporary 
treatment options for voiding dysfunction after ONB in females.
RECENT FINDINGS: Meticulous surgical technique in the form of urethral 
nerve-sparing has been shown to play an important role in maintaining 
continence, as has sparing the uterus when possible. Data supporting the 
effectiveness of lifestyle measures, urethral bulking, pubovaginal slings, and 
transobturator slings in the treatment of urinary incontinence are widely 
variable and limited to case reports. Urinary retention is still most 
effectively managed with self-catheterization. Voiding dysfunction after ONB can 
be devastating. Recent advances focus on improving surgical techniques to 
decrease the risk of incontinence and retention, as post-operative management 
options are limited.

PURPOSE: Sphincter-preserving operations performed with bladder-preserving 
surgery and a cystourethral anastomosis (CUA) do not require a urinary stoma, 
but leakage from the CUA may develop. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
efficacy of performing an additional flap operation.
METHODS: The subjects were 39 patients who underwent bladder-preserving surgery 
for advanced rectal cancer involving the prostate, between 2001 and 2015.32 of 
whom had a CUA and one of whom had a neobladder. Five of these 32 patients 
underwent an ileal flap operation, 2 underwent an omental flap operation, and 3 
underwent an operation using both flaps.
RESULTS: Leakage developed in 3 (30%) of the 10 patients who underwent 
additional flap operations, but in 14 (60.9%) of the 23 patients who did not 
undergo a flap operation. The mean periods of catheterization for the patients 
who suffered leakage were 31 weeks (8-108 weeks) in those without a flap and 16 
weeks (8-20 weeks) in those with a flap. Four (33.3%) of the 12 patients with 
leakage after surgery without a flap had a period of urinary catheterization >30 
weeks, and 2 (16.7%) had leakage of CTCAE grade 3. There were no cases of 
leakage after flap surgery.
CONCLUSION: An additional flap operation may decrease the risk of leakage from a 
CUA.

CONTEXT: Pelvic organ-preserving radical cystectomy (POPRC) for women may 
improve postoperative sexual and urinary functions without compromising the 
oncological outcome compared with standard radical cystectomy (RC).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of POPRC on sexual, oncological and urinary 
outcomes compared with RC in women who undergo standard curative surgery and 
orthotopic neobladder substitution for bladder cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline, Embase, Cochrane controlled trials databases and 
clinicaltrial.gov were systematically searched for all relevant publications. 
Women with bladder cancer who underwent POPRC or standard RC and orthotopic 
neobladder substitution with curative intent were included. Prospective and 
retrospective comparative studies and single-arm case series were included. The 
primary outcomes were sexual function at 6-12 months after surgery and 
oncological outcomes including disease recurrence and overall survival (OS) at 
>2 years. Secondary outcomes included urinary continence at 6-12 months. Risk of 
bias (RoB) assessment was performed using standard Cochrane review methodology 
including additional domains based on confounder assessment.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The searches yielded 11 941 discrete articles, of which 15 
articles reporting on 15 studies recruiting a total of 874 patients were 
eligible for inclusion. Three papers had a matched-pair study design and the 
rest of the studies were mainly small, retrospective case series. Sexual 
outcomes were reported in seven studies with 167/194 patients (86%) having 
resumed sexual activity within 6 months postoperatively, with median (range) 
patients' sexual satisfaction score of 88.5 (80-100)%. Survival outcomes were 
reported in seven studies on 197 patients, with a mean follow-up of between 12 
and 132 months. At 3 and 5 years, cancer-specific survival was 70-100% and OS 
was 65-100%. In all, 11 studies reported continence outcomes. Overall, the 
daytime and night-time continence rates were 58-100% and 42-100%, respectively. 
Overall, the self-catheterisation rate was 9.5-78%. Due to poor reporting and 
large heterogeneity between studies, instead of subgroup-analysis, a narrative 
synthesis approach was used. The overall RoB was high across all studies.
CONCLUSION: For well-selected patients, POPRC with orthotopic neobladder may 
potentially be comparable to standard RC for oncological outcomes, whilst 
improving sexual and urinary function outcomes. However, in women undergoing RC, 
oncological and functional data regarding POPRC remain immature and require 
further evaluation in a prospective comparative setting.

Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in the urinary system. 
Radical cystectomy is inevitable when bladder cancer progresses to a 
muscle-invasive disease. However, cystectomy still causes a high risk of death 
and a low quality of life (such as ureter-abdomen ostomy, uroclepsia for 
ileal-colon neobladder). Therefore, more effective treatments as well as bladder 
preservation are needed. We developed self-assembled tumor-targeting hyaluronic 
acid-IR-780 nanoparticles for photothermal ablation in over-expressing CD44 (the 
receptor for HA) bladder cancer, which show high tumor selectivity, high 
treatment efficacy, good bioavailability, and excellent biocompatibility. The 
nanoparticles demonstrated a stable spherical nanostructure in aqueous 
conditions with good mono-dispersity, and their average size was 171.3±9.14nm. 
The nanoparticles can be degraded by hyaluronidase when it is over-expressed in 
bladder cells; therefore, they appear to have a hyaluronidase-responsive 
"OFF/ON" behavior of a fluorescence signal. HA-IR-780 NPs also showed high 
photothermal efficiency; 2.5, 5, 10 and 20μg/mL of NPs had a maximum temperature 
increase of 11.2±0.66°C, 18.6±0.75°C, 26.8±1.11°C and 32.3±1.42°C. The in vitro 
cell viability showed that MB-49 cells could be efficiently ablated by combining 
HA-IR-780 NPs with 808nm laser irradiation. Then, in vivo biodistribution showed 
the HA-IR-780 NPs are targeted for accumulation in bladder cancer cells but have 
negligible accumulation in normal bladder wall. The photothermal therapeutic 
efficacy of HA-IR-780 NPs in the orthotopic bladder cancer model showed tumors 
treated with NPs had a maximum temperature of 48.1±1.81°C after 6min of laser 
irradiation. The tumor volume was approximately 65-75mm3 prior to treatment. 
After 12days, the tumor sizes for the PBS, PBS plus laser irradiation and 
HA-IR-780 NPs-treated groups were 784.75mm3, 707.5mm3, and 711.37mm3, 
respectively. None of the tumors in the HA-IR-780 NPs plus laser 
irradiation-treated group were visible to the naked eye. A toxicity study showed 
HA-IR-780 NPs (2.5-20mg/kg, i.v.) were nontoxic and safe for in vivo 
applications. HA-IR-780 nanoparticles address current clinical challenges, 
treating locally aggressive lesions and preserving the bladder. They have 
enormous potential to improve the bladder cancer treatment strategies in clinic.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 1) Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent 
malignancies in the urinary system. Radical cystectomy is inevitable while 
bladder cancer progress to muscle-invasive disease. 2) We developed 
self-assembled tumor-targeting hyaluronic acid-IR-780 nanoparticles for 
photothermal ablation in over-expressing CD44 (the receptor for HA) bladder 
cancer. 3) Photothermal therapeutic efficacy of HA-IR-780 NPs in orthotopic 
bladder cancer model showed tumors were completely ablated. 4) HA-IR-780 
nanoparticles address current clinical challenges, treating locally aggressive 
lesions as well as for bladder preservation.

OBJECTIVES: For many years, creation of an orthotopic neobladder after 
cystectomy has been popular. In the present study, we measured the extent of 
metabolic acidosis in patients with ileal neobladders compared with ileal 
conduits and defined risk factors for development of metabolic acidosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 95 patients, who underwent radical 
cystectomy and urinary diversion to treat invasive bladder cancer from January 
2001 to December 2014 at Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, 
through investigation of acid-base balance, serum electrolyte levels and renal 
function one month and one year after operation.
RESULTS: One month after the operation, metabolic acidosis was found from 18 
patients (31.0%) in an ileal neobladder group and from 4 (14.8%) in an ileal 
conduits group. One year after the operation, the numbers became 11 (22.9%) and 
2 (10.0%), respectively. However, there was not a statistical difference. The 
blood biochemical profiles of the two groups did not differ significantly after 
urinary diversion. Logistic analysis revealed that lower estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with metabolic acidosis at one month (odds 
ratio, OR = 0.94 [0.91-0.97]; p < 0.001) and one year (OR = 0.94 [0.92-0.97]; 
P = 0.001) after urinary diversion. In multivariate analysis, lower eGFR is a 
significant risk factor for metabolic acidosis at one month.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ileal neobladders and conduits are at the similar 
risk of metabolic acidosis. A close association between renal function and 
development of metabolic acidosis was observed, especially stronger in an early 
period after operation.

Ileal Neobladder: An Important Cause of Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis.

Boston, Massachusetts and Department of Emergency Medicine, Harvard Medical 
School, Boston, Massachusetts.

BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is 
probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap 
metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence 
of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a 
severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and 
ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Part of 
the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes 
patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a 
non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid 
load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when 
resuscitating these patients.

Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for organ-confined 
high-grade recurrent or muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder 
urinary diversion following cystectomy represents an option for patients wishing 
for continent urinary diversion. Female patients who undergo radical cystectomy 
with orthotopic bladder substitution are at risk for developing both common and 
neobladder-specific disorders of the pelvic floor, including urinary 
incontinence, hypercontinence, vaginal prolapse, and neobladder-vaginal fistula. 
Each of these sequelae can have significant impact on the patient's quality of 
life. Due to the increased frequency of orthotopic neobladder creation in women, 
subspecialty urologists are more likely to confront such pelvic floor disorders 
in bladder cancer survivors. This review presents the most current information 
on the treatment of pelvic floor disorders after orthotopic bladder 
substitution.

PURPOSE: To introduce a new method of constructing an orthotopic ileal 
neobladder with bilateral isoperistaltic afferent limbs, and to describe its 
clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2013, 16 patients underwent 
a new method of orthotopic ileal neobladder after laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy for bladder cancer. To construct the neobladder, an ileal segment 
60cm long was isolated approximately 25cm proximally to the ileocecum. The 
proximal 20cm of the ileal segment was divided into two parts for bilateral 
isoperistaltic afferent limbs. The proximal 10cm of the ileal segment was moved 
to the distal end of the ileal segment for the right isoperistaltic afferent 
limb, and the remaining proximal 10cm ileal segment was reserved for the left 
isoperistaltic afferent limb. The remaining length of the 40cm ileal segment was 
detubularized along its antimesenteric border to form a reservoir. The 
neobladder was sutured to achieve a spherical configuration.
RESULTS: All procedures were carried out successfully. The mean operative time 
was 330 min, mean blood loss was 328mL, and mean hospital stay was 12.5 days. 
The mean neobladder capacity 6 and 12 months after surgery was 300mL and 401mL, 
respectively. With a mean follow-up of 22.8 months, all patients achieved 
daytime continence and 15 achieved nighttime continence. The mean peak urinary 
flow rate was 11.9mL/s and 12.8mL/s at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel procedure is feasible, safe, simple to perform, and 
provides encouraging functional outcomes. However, comparative studies with 
long-term follow-up are required to prove its superiority.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical technique we used to perform a stentless 
intracorporeal ureteroenteric anastomosis and to determine the outcomes in this 
initial series.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospective database of all 
patients undergoing robotic-assisted intracorporeal urinary diversion with 
stentless ureteroenteric anastomosis between March 2014 and July 2016. 
Diversions were performed at the time of either robotic-assisted laparoscopic 
cystectomy for bladder cancer or urinary diversion for other indications.
RESULTS: A total of 10 patients underwent implantation of 20 ureters into the 
intestine via a robotic-assisted approach with intentional omission of stents. 
Median body mass index was 29.57 (first quartile 23.68, third quartile 34.69). 
Median American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 3 (range 2-3). Seven 
patients had intracorporeal ileal conduit reconstruction and 3 patients had an 
intracorporeal neobladder creation. There were no patients who developed a 
stricture of the ureter nor did any patient develop a leak at the ureteroenteric 
anastomosis. All patients had normal serum creatinine at least 4 weeks after 
surgery, and all patients had follow-up computed tomography of the kidneys, 
which were normal. The median follow-up was 8 months (first quartile = 3 months, 
third quartile = 17 months).
CONCLUSION: Robotic intracorporeal urinary diversion with intentional omission 
of ureteral stents is a safe and feasible option when establishing continuity of 
the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of radical resection of secondary cancers 
after ureterosigmoidostomy. Ureterosigmoidostomy was the most common continent 
urinary diversion before the era of continent cutaneous diversion and 
neobladders, specifically in children. When performed for bladder exstrophy, 
patients will live with this kind of diversion for quite a long time. As a 
result, urologists will be confronted with patients presenting with an 
adenocarcinoma in their ureterosigmoidostomy. In most cases reported in the 
literature, an ileal conduit was used for urinary conversion. However, nowadays 
an ileal loop must not be the only solution for patients with a long life 
expectancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2015, 6 patients were treated for an 
adenocarcinoma in their ureterosigmoidostomy. All patients underwent radical 
resection of the tumor-bearing sigmoid colon. After thorough preoperative 
informed consent concerning the choice of future urinary diversion, such as 
conversion to an ileal conduit, construction of a continent catheterizable 
pouch, or repeat continent anal diversion, 4 patients chose a repeat continent 
anal urinary diversion.
RESULTS: Up to this date, no complications or recurrences were seen after a 
median follow-up of 35 months.
CONCLUSION: In patients with secondary malignancy of the colon, radical 
resection of the tumor-bearing bowel segment is mandatory. A repeat continent 
anal urinary diversion appears to be a feasible alternative to secondary urinary 
diversion after resection of the tumor-bearing sigmoid colon. However, a longer 
follow-up is required to determine whether the risk of secondary malignancy 
remains unchanged, and whether the risk is increased or decreased.

This study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of robotic assisted 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy with pure intracorporeal modified Ves.Pa 
neobladder with stentless ureteroileal anastomosis. Pure intracorporeal robotic 
assisted laparoscopic technique has been recently developed with a select number 
of high-volume centers utilizing various operative and neobladder techniques. We 
reviewed the patient characteristics, operative details and perioperative 
courses in the two patients who have undergone robotic assisted laparoscopic 
radical cystectomy with pure intracorporeal modified Ves.Pa neobladder and one 
who has undergone the Hautmann W neobladder. These results were compared to 
other contemporary robotic neobladder series. We demonstrate technical success 
with similar operative and perioperative results with the modified Ves.Pa 
neobladder. The robotic pure intracorporeal modified Ves.Pa neobladder is a 
technically feasible operation and may be easier to perform compared to other 
neobladders. Initial experience suggests operative time and perioperative 
outcomes are similar to other robotic techniques.

In the present report, we describe a patient with microcystic variant of 
urothelial carcinoma in urinary bladder. In March 2016, a 71-year-old man 
presented with bladder tumors found incidentally by ultrasonography. Cystoscopy 
and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple invasive tumor 
of posterior wall, with a maximum diameter of 33 mm. Transurethral resection 
(TUR) of bladder tumors was performed. Pathological diagnosis was urothelial 
carcinoma, high grade, T2 or more. Invasive urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed 
and laparoscopic radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder was performed 
accordingly in April 2016. Pathological findings indicated a diagnosis of 
microcystic variant of urothelial carcinoma. At present, six months after 
surgery, the patient remains free of recurrence and metastasis. Here we review 
the characteristics of 4 microcystic variant of urothelial carcinoma cases 
reported in Japan.

OBJECTIVES: To analyse the impact of perioperative complications and complex 
treatment courses on postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after 
radical cystectomy (RC) and continent (ONB) or incontinent (IC) urinary 
diversion at multiple prospective time points.
METHODS: A total of 121 consecutive patients underwent RC with curative intent 
between 2013 and 2014. HRQOL was prospectively assessed preoperatively, after 3 
and 12 months, using the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The impact of complex 
perioperative treatment courses including cases requiring surgical 
re-interventions was retrospectively assessed using Martin criteria and the 
Clavien-Dindo scale. Urinary continence was determined using the validated 
ICIQ-SF questionnaire. Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, 
Spearman's rank correlation, and ordinal regression models (p < 0.05).
RESULTS: A total of 100 patients underwent further analysis. Physical 
functioning (PF), role functioning (RF), and global health status (GHS) scores 
were higher in the ONB subgroup both preoperatively (p < 0.001, 0.010, 0.048) 
and 3 months after RC (p = 0.003, 0.048, 0.019). Clavien complications ≥III led 
to reduced PF levels after 3 months (p = 0.050) without effect on GHS 
(p = 0.825). Operating time and length of critical care monitoring correlated 
with 3 months pain scores in the ONB subgroup (p = 0.003, 0.009) without 
affecting GHS (p = 0.603, 0.653). Continent urinary diversion was an independent 
predictor of increased HRQOL after 3 months (p = 0.021), however, not after 
12 months (p = 0.803).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving an IC have lower PF, RF, and GHS scores than 
those receiving ONB. Perioperative complications and complicated treatment 
courses can affect HRQOL subdomains but do not significantly impact the GHS. ONB 
is an independent predictor for better overall HRQOL 3 months, but not 12 months 
after RC.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of long-acting-release octreotide (trade name 
Sandostatin) on decreasing mucus secretion, thus reducing catheter obstruction 
after radical cystectomy and orthotopic reconstruction.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we treated 
73 cases of radical cystectomy between the years 2008 and 2014; 65 were deemed 
eligible for the study. Cases were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 
32) received 2 doses of 20 mg intramuscular long-acting-release octreotide 4 
weeks before and on the day of surgery, while group B (n = 33) received placebo. 
Catheter irrigation was only performed when there was an obstruction due to a 
mucus plug. The need for catheter irrigation and the volume of mucus produced by 
the neobladder were evaluated and compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: The average number of neobladder irrigations required to treat mucus 
plugs was 2.3 ± 1.5 in group A and 9.5 ± 4.3 in group B (P < .001) before 
hospital discharge. This number changed to 2.5 ± 1.5 versus 11.4 ± 2.7 in groups 
A and B, respectively (P < .001), after discharge from the hospital. The 24-hour 
mucus production at the end of the first week was 5.4 ± 2.7 mL versus 21.5 ± 5.6 
mL in groups A and B, respectively (P < .001). At the end of the third week, 
this amount changed to 5.5 ± 2.3 mL versus 21.8 ± 5.6 mL in groups A and B, 
respectively (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Two injections of long-acting-release octreotide can dramatically 
reduce mucus production and hence catheter obstruction due to mucus plugs after 
radical cystectomy and orthotopic reconstruction.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the implementation phase of a robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) programme including side-effect profiles and impact on length 
of stay (LOS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 114 consecutive patients (82% male) underwent RARC 
and urinary diversion between April 2013 and December 2015 [ileal conduit (97 
patients) and orthotopic neobladder (17)]. Surgery was performed by two surgeons 
within a designated regional cancer centre. No exclusion criteria were applied. 
All patients were managed on the Exeter Enhanced Recovery Pathway (ERP) in a 
unit where embedded enhanced recovery practice was already established. Data 
were collected prospectively on the national cystectomy registry - the British 
Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) Complex Operations Dataset.
RESULTS: RARC was technically feasible in all but one case. The mean operating 
time was 3-5 h with an overall transfusion rate of 8.8%. There were higher-grade 
complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV) in 18.4% of patients, with a 30-day 
mortality rate of 0.9%. The median (range) LOS after RARC was 7 (3-68) days, 
with a re-admission rate of 18.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: The present series shows that RARC can be safely implemented in a 
unit experienced in robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Case-selection in this setting 
is not deemed necessary. There are benefits in terms of lower transfusion rates 
and reduced LOS. The side-effect profile appears to differ from that of open RC, 
and despite the fact that complication rate is equivalent; 'technical' 
complications are over-represented in the RAS group. As such, they should 
improve with experience, recognition, and modification of surgical technique. 
ERPs can be safely applied to all patients undergoing RARC to maximise the 
benefits of minimally invasive surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the major improvements in surgical technique and 
perioperative care, radical cystectomy (RC) remains a major operative procedure 
with a significant morbidity and mortality. The present study analyzes the early 
complications of RC and urinary diversion using a standardized reporting system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Modified Clavien-Dindo classification was used to 
retrospectively assess the peri-operative course of 212 patients who had RC with 
urinary diversion between October 2003 and October 2014 at a single institution. 
The indications for surgery were muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma, 
high-grade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (BC), and Bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin-resistant nonmuscle invasive BCs. Data on age, sex, 
comorbidities, smoking history, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, 
and peri-operative complications (up to 90 days) were captured. Statistical 
analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software (Chicago, USA).
RESULTS: The mean age was 56.15 ± 10.82. Orthotopic neobladder was created in 
113 patients, ileal conduit in 88 patients, and cutaneous ureterostomy in 11 
patients. A total of 292 complications were recorded in 136/212 patients. 242 
complications (81.16%) occurred in the first 30 days, with the remaining 50 
complications (18.83%) occurring thereafter. The rates for overall complication 
were 64.1%. The most common complications were hematologic (21.6%). Most of the 
complications were of Grade I and II (22.9% and 48.9%, respectively). Grade 
IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, and V complications were observed in 10.2%, 8.9%, 3.4%, 
2.7%, and 2.7% of the patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: RC and urinary diversion are associated with significant morbidity. 
This audit would help in setting a benchmark for further improvement in the 
outcome.

OBJECTIVE: Functional outcomes after ileal bladder substitution reflect the 
expectations of future patients at a particular centre. The aim of this study 
was to use validated questionnaires and a pad-weighing test to investigate 
functional outcomes after neobladder reconstruction at long-term follow-up in 
patients at a single centre.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 2005 - 2015, 75 patients received a Studer ileal 
bladder substitute at the Department of Urology, Malmö. Forty-six of these 
patients were alive for follow-up and were evaluated using the pad-weighing test 
and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary 
Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) 
and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).
RESULTS: Five of 37 evaluable patients (14%) were considered fully continent, 
reporting a pad-weighing test result of 0 g and an ICIQ-UI-SF score of 0. The 
median ICIQ-UI-SF score was 8 [interquartile range (IQR) 3-11], and seven 
patients (17%) were continent according to the ICIQ-UI-SF score only. In the 
pad-weighing test, 28 out of 37 patients (76%) reported 0 g day-time leakage 
whereas only 12 out of 37 patients (32%) reported 0 g night-time leakage. At 
follow-up, nine out of 39 (23%) of evaluable male patients were potent. The 
median ICIQ-UI-SF score was significantly lower during the second half of the 
study period [4 (IQR 0-8) vs 10 (IQR 6-14); p = .003]. The inverse applied to 
the median IIEF score [5 (IQR 3-12) vs 2 (IQR 1-4); p = .02].
CONCLUSIONS: Functional outcomes at long-term follow-up after radical cystectomy 
and Studer ileal bladder substitute were at best modest in this series. Better 
outcomes during the second half of the study period might be explained by 
improved patient selection and a refined surgical technique, but possibly also 
by longer follow-up of patients during the first half of the period resulting in 
a more pronounced time-dependent decline in functional outcomes.

PURPOSE: To analyse prognostic features on quality of life (QoL) following 
radical cystectomy and urinary diversion via orthotopic neobladder in a 
single-centre patient cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postoperative QoL of 152 patients was assessed 
retrospectively using the validated QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Potential 
associations of patient's quality of life including pre-and intraoperative 
characteristics, surgeon experience, postoperative time course, adjuvant 
therapies, and functional outcome were defined a priori and evaluated. 
Mann-Whitney-U-, Kruskal-Wallis-, Spearman correlation and post hoctesting were 
used. A multivariate analysis using a multiple logistic regression model was 
performed. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 48 months. Univariate analysis of prognostic 
features for health-related QoL revealed a significant impact of gender 
(p=0.019), performance status (p<0.001), experience of surgeon (>100 previous 
cystectomies, p=0.007), and nerve-sparing surgery (p=0.001). Patients who 
underwent secondary chemotherapy or radiotherapy had significant lower QLQ-C30 
scores (p=0.04, p=0.02 respectively). Patients who were asymptomatic had a 
significantly higher quality of life (p<0.001). A significant impact of severity 
of incontinence based on ICIQ-SF score (p<0.001) and daily pad usage (p<0.001), 
existence of daytime incontinence (p<0.001), existence of urgency symptoms 
(p=0.007), and IIEF-5 score (p<0.001) could be observed. In multivariate 
analysis, independent prognostic relevance could be confirmed for preoperative 
ECOG performance status of 0 (p=0.020 vs. ECOG 1, p=0.047 vs. ECOG 2), 
experience of the respective surgeon (≥100 vs. <100 previous cystectomies, 
p=0.021), and daytime continence (p=0.032).
CONCLUSION: In the present study, we report health-related QoL outcomes in a 
contemporary patient cohort and confirm preoperative ECOG status, surgeon 
experience and daytime incontinence as independent prognostic features for a 
good postoperative QoL.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review different management modalities 
and outcome of patients presenting with late intestinal obstruction (IO) after 
radical cystectomy (RC) or palliative cystectomy (PC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Files of patients who presented with IO between January 
1978 and June 2014 were reviewed. Patients who developed IO following either RC 
or PC more than 30 days after surgery were included. Patients' characteristics 
and management protocols were evaluated. Predictors for failure of conservative 
management and unfavorable outcome after surgical explorations were evaluated. 
Symptom-free and overall survival rates of patients with malignant IO was were 
recorded.
RESULTS: The prevalence of IO was 2.8% after RC (118 out of 4199 patients) and 
10% after PC (nine out of 87). Colonic diversions had the highest prevalence 
(6.2%), followed by ileal loop conduit (2.9%); the lowest prevalences followed 
Kock pouch and ileal W neobladder (1.7% and 1.6%, respectively). Postoperative 
urinary leakage from a ureteroenteric anastomosis was the only predictor for 
surgical intervention (p = 0.039). Nine cases had been explored for malignant 
obstruction (eight after RC and one after PC). The mean ± SD elapsed time before 
death was 3.6 ± 2 months (range 0.5-17 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary diversion with colonic segments carries more risk for the 
development of IO in comparison with ileal segments. Postoperative urinary 
leakage after cystectomy and urinary diversion may be a contributory factor for 
surgical exploration in cases with late IO.

Bladder exstrophy is a rare malformation. Ureteral diversion, such as 
ureterosigmoidostomy or a neorectal bladder, has been described. When the 
patients reach adulthood, cancer may arise in these reconstructions. Our aim was 
to perform a systematic review (all languages) of the published literature on 
neoplasia after urinary diversion and suggested management in cases of cancer. 
PubMed and Cochrane library were searched for relevant articles published within 
the last 20 years. All identified articles were reviewed for inclusion. 
Carcinoma occurring in the bladder and unreconstructed exstrophy were excluded. 
Out of 47 articles found, 12 matched our search criteria. The outcomes of 23 
patients (including 2 from the authors' institution) were reported. Twenty-two 
patients with adenocarcinoma and 1 with carcinoid tumour were identified. Median 
age at urinary diversion was 3 (range 1-13) years. There were 20 
ureterosigmoidostomies and 2 neorectal bladders. Cancer was diagnosed 
subsequently at a median of 31 (range 5-55) years after urinary diversion still 
in place (n = 18) or 21 years (range 1-30) after incomplete excision of ureteric 
stump when re-diverted (n = 5). The long-term outcomes of 15 patients were 
available. Ten died due to colorectal adenocarcinoma, and 5 were disease-free at 
3 years. Patients with enteric diversion for bladder exstrophy, including those 
with subsequent reconstruction, are at risk of adenocarcinoma during adulthood. 
It is important to provide adequate surveillance. If lesions suggestive of 
carcinoma are seen, complete excision of the receptive bowel and urinary 
diversion are mandatory.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the necessity of chronic alkali therapy in non-complicated 
orthotopic ileal neobladders with normal renal function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study that included 200 male 
patients who underwent radical cystectomy and ileal W neobladder for invasive 
bladder carcinoma between January 1993 and December 2013. The studied patients 
included 100 consecutive patients who were maintained on regular alkali therapy 
since surgery and 100 consecutive patients who stopped the use of alkali 
treatment after initial 3 months postoperative with minimum postoperative 
observation time of 1 year. All patients had satisfactory function of the 
reservoirs with normal upper tract. The patients were subjected to blood 
analysis for creatnine, electrolytes, pH and bicarbonate and urine chemical 
analysis. The study also included 40 healthy male age-matched volunteers who 
served as a control group.
RESULTS: Both groups were comparable as regard age, BMI, follow-up period and 
surgical technique. There were no significant differences between both groups as 
regard serum creatnine, electrolytes blood pH and bicarbonate and the mean 
values were within normal range; however, the neobladder patients are still 
toward the acidotic side in comparison to healthy volunteers. Also there were no 
significant differences between both groups of patients as regard urine pH and 
excretion of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus and creatnine.
CONCLUSION: Patients with non-complicated ileal neobladders with normal upper 
tract who were not maintained on alkali prophylaxis for long period have a 
compensated acid base status. Therefore, the prolonged alkali prophylaxis is not 
mandatory.

BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
neobladder reconstruction is a challenging procedure. The need for surgical 
skills and the long operative times have led to concern about its 
reproducibility.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate our technique for RARC and totally intracorporeal 
orthotopic Padua ileal bladder.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From August 2012 to February 2014, 45 
patients underwent this technique at a single tertiary referral centre.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: RARC, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and 
intracorporeal partly stapled neobladder. Surgical steps are demonstrated in the 
accompanying video.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographics, clinical, and pathological data were collected. 
Perioperative, 2-yr oncologic and 2-yr functional outcomes were reported.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Intraoperative transfusion or conversion to open 
surgery was not necessary in any case and intracorporeal neobladder was 
successfully performed in all 45 patients. Median operative time was 305min 
(interquartile range [IQR]: 282-345). Median estimated blood loss was 210ml 
(IQR: 50-250). Median hospital stay was 9 d (IQR: 7-12). The overall incidence 
of perioperative, 30-d and 180-d complications were 44.4%, 57.8%, and 77.8%, 
respectively, while severe complications occurred in17.8%, 17.8%, and 35.5%, 
respectively. Two-yr daytime and night-time continence rates were 73.3% and 
55.5%, respectively. Two-yr disease free survival, cancer specific survival, and 
overall survival rates were 72.5%, 82.3%, and 82.4%, respectively. The small 
sample size and high caseload of the centre might affect the reproducibility of 
these results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience supports the feasibility of totally intracorporeal 
neobladder following RARC. Operative times and perioperative complication rates 
are likely to be reduced with increasing experience.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We report the outcomes of our first 45 consecutive patients who 
underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladders. 
Perioperative, oncologic, and functional outcomes support this technique as a 
feasible and safe surgical option in tertiary referral centres.

PURPOSE: We evaluated continence outcomes in male patients undergoing orthotopic 
neobladder diversion after radical cystectomy using a validated questionnaire.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using our institutional review board approved bladder 
cancer database we identified 1,269 patients who underwent open radical 
cystectomy from 2002 to 2015. Orthotopic neobladder was constructed in 935 (74%) 
patients, of whom 798 (85%) were male. Beginning in 2012 the patients completed 
a validated pictorial pad use questionnaire at each followup visit. The 
questionnaire assessed pad number, size and wetness as well as catheter use. 
Continence was defined as use of no pads or pads that are almost dry. 
Questionnaires were stratified into distinct postoperative intervals for 
analysis. Female patients, or patients with artificial urinary sphincters or 
prior radiotherapy were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: A total of 188 male patients with available questionnaires were 
followed from September 2012 to August 2015. Overall 447 questionnaires were 
collected, with 351 interval distinct questionnaires separated into intervals of 
less than 3, 3 to 6, more than 6 to 12, more than 12 to 18, more than 18 to 36 
and more than 36 months after surgery (64, 61, 58, 49, 61 and 58 questionnaires, 
respectively). Daytime continence increased from 59% at less than 3 months 
postoperatively to 92% by more than 12 to 18 months. Nighttime continence 
increased from 28% at less than 3 months postoperatively to 51% by more than 18 
to 36 months. Nearly 50% of patients reported daytime and nighttime continence 
by 18 to 36 months.
CONCLUSIONS: After orthotopic neobladder diversion in male patients, continence 
improves significantly by 6 months and subsequently plateaus with 92% daytime 
continence by more than 12 to 18 months. Orthotopic neobladder represents an 
excellent functional option for urinary diversion.

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the long-term oncological and functional 
outcomes of postoperative total parenteral nutrition after radical cystectomy.
METHODS: A total of 157 consecutive patients (≤cT3, cN0, cM0) who underwent 
extended pelvic lymph node dissection, radical cystectomy and ileal urinary 
diversion from September 2008 to March 2011 at a single center were randomized 
to receive either postoperative total parenteral nutrition (group A; n = 74) or 
oral nutrition alone (group B; n = 83). All but two patients in group B (who 
were thus excluded from further analysis) had regular postoperative follow up at 
the Department of Urology, University of Bern, Switzerland. Computed tomography 
and bone scan were carried out to assess local recurrences and distal 
metastases. We used validated questionnaires to evaluate bowel function, sexual 
function and quality of life, and an institutional questionnaire to evaluate 
neobladder function.
RESULTS: The median follow up was 50 months (IQR 21-62). The rate of local 
recurrences (4/74 [5.4%] in group A; 4/81 [4.9%] in group B; P = 0.9) and the 
rate of distant metastases (23/74 [31%] in group A; 23/81 [28%] in group B; P = 
0.72) did not differ between the two groups. There was no difference in 
cancer-specific (P = 0.86) and overall survival (P = 0.85). Group B patients had 
significantly better bowel function at 3 months (P = 0.03) and 12 months (P = 
0.01). There was no difference in terms of quality of life, and sexual and 
neobladder function.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of total parenteral nutrition after radical 
cystectomy does not impair long-term oncological outcomes. It does, however, 
negatively influence long-term bowel function.

OBJECTIVES: To review our experience in robot-assisted radical cystectomy, 
assessing the complications and oncological and functional results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2007 to 2014, we performed 67 robot-assisted radical 
cystectomies combined with lymphadenectomy in 61 cases. The operations were 
performed on 37 patients due to muscle-invasive tumours and on 30 due to 
high-risk nonmuscle-invasive tumours. Urinary diversion was conducted 
extracorporeally, using a Studer neobladder in 47 cases.
RESULTS: The mean blood loss was 300mL. No case required conversion to open 
surgery. The median number of lymph nodes extracted was 16 (range 3-33). 
Pathology revealed 16 pT0, 15 pTis,-pT1-pTa and 44 muscle-invasive tumours, 8 
pN+ and 1 with positive margins. The mean hospital stay was 9 days. With a 
median follow-up of 16 months, 9 (13%) patients were readmitted after the 
discharge, most for infections associated with the vesical catheter and other 
catheters. Forty patients (59.7%) presented complications (most were Clavien 
grade 1-2). There was recurrence during the follow-up in 4 cases (6%), and 4 
(5.9%) patients died from cancer. Nineteen (28.3%) patients had complications 
after 30 days, most of which were urinary tract infections. Of the 47 patients 
with a neobladder, 45 (96%) had proper daytime continence and 42 (89%) had 
proper nighttime continence. Ninety percent and 64% of the patients with 
previously normal sexual function and reduced sexual function, respectively, 
were able to preserve sexual function with or without drug treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy plus lymphadenectomy, with 
extracorporeal reconstruction of the urinary diversion, offers good oncological 
and functional results without increasing the number of complications.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes of patients following a first-line systematic 
endourologic procedure used to treat ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures 
(UEAS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All data from patients treated using a first-line 
endourologic approach for UEAS between 2010 and 2015 were reviewed 
retrospectively. The following data were analyzed: age, type of urinary 
diversion, initial symptoms, surgical endoscopic approach (antegrade or 
retrograde), pre- and postoperative creatinine levels, and postoperative 
complications and outcomes. Follow-up visits occurred at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 
6 months postoperatively, and at least annually thereafter.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients (median age: 62.5 years) were included. Overall, 
28 UEAS were treated endoscopically (ileal conduit: n = 25; neobladder: n = 3). 
Most UEAS developed following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (n = 19). 
Overall, the endoscopic approach was successful in 20 cases (71.4%). The UEAS 
length was >1 cm in 21 cases (75%). All UEAS of <1 cm were treated successfully 
(n = 7). There were three grade II and five grade III complications. The median 
follow-up period was 25 months. The median creatinine levels before surgery and 
at last follow-up were 1.3 mg/dL and 0.9 mg/dL, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An endourologic procedure is a reasonable option for first-line 
treatment for UEAS and has promising functional outcomes and limited morbidity.

PURPOSE: We provide a step-by-step description of our technique of nerve and 
seminal vesicle sparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy with an orthotopic 
neobladder. We also present preliminary oncologic and functional outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nerve and seminal vesicle sparing robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy with a modified Y-shaped orthotopic neobladder was performed by the 
same surgeon in 40 men with clinically localized bladder cancer from January 
2011 to September 2014. Operative, perioperative and pathological data as well 
as continence and erectile function outcomes are presented.
RESULTS: Median followup was 26.5 months (range 8 to 52). A soft tissue positive 
surgical margin was found in a patient with pT3a disease. A global rate of 30% 
early and 32.5% late complications was observed. However, the grade III or 
higher complication rate was low in both settings at 2.5% and 5%, respectively. 
There was 1 cancer related death 23 months after surgery. Of the 40 patients 30 
(75%) gained daytime continence (0 pad) within 1 month postoperatively. The 
12-month nocturnal continence rate was 72.5% (29 of 40 patients). Mean 
preoperative IIEF-6 (International Index of Erectile Function-6) score was 24.4. 
Erectile function returned to normal, defined as an IIEF-6 score greater than 
17, in 31 of 40 patients (77.5%) within 3 months while 29 of 40 patients (72.5%) 
returned to the preoperative IIEF-6 score within 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In the hands of an experienced surgeon nerve and seminal vesicle 
sparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal reconstruction of 
the neobladder seems feasible and safe. It provides short-term oncologic 
efficacy and promising functional outcomes. Yet comparative, long-term followup 
studies with standard open cystectomy are required.

BACKGROUND: Small cell bladder cancer (SCBC) is an aggressive subtype accounting 
for less than 1 % of all bladder malignancies associated with rapid progression, 
early metastases formation and high mortality rates.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present an unusual long term disease free survival of a 
60 year-old man who was diagnosed with SCBC two and a half years ago. He 
underwent four cycles of cisplatin/etoposide chemotherapy as well as a 
prophylactic whole-brain radiotherapy followed by a radical cystoprostatectomy 
and ileal neobladder with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Since 33 months the 
patient is now recurrence-free.
CONCLUSION: In this case report, we were able to show that early multimodal 
therapy results in long term disease free survival, thus we highly recommend 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a part of multimodal management of a primary 
metastases-free, localized and surgically resectable SCBC.

PURPOSE: To assess socioeconomic disparities in urinary diversion utilization in 
a contemporary American cohort.
METHODS: In the National Cancer Database, we identified 4538 patients who 
underwent cystectomy with urinary diversion for clinical T1-2N0M0 bladder cancer 
from 2010 to 2013. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify 
predictors of urinary diversion type: ileal conduit (IC), continent cutaneous 
reservoir (CCR), or orthotopic neobladder (ON). Covariates included age, gender, 
race, income, Charlson score, clinical T stage, hospital cystectomy volume, 
teaching status, and surgical approach. Subgroup analysis by hospital volume 
(low, intermediate, or high) and teaching status (academic or non-academic) was 
performed to ascertain the impact of regionalization on urinary diversion use.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 4066 (89.6 %) patients with IC, 292 (6.4 %) 
with CCR, and 180 (4.0 %) with ON. On multivariable analysis, younger age 
(p < .01), higher income (p < .01), and high cystectomy volume predicted 
increased use of CCR and ON. Female gender predicted increased use of CCR versus 
IC (p < .01), and academic hospital status predicted increased use of ON versus 
IC (p = .04). On subgroup analysis, after further adjustment for hospital volume 
and teaching status, higher income remained an independent predictor of ON use.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite regionalization of care, higher income patients are more 
likely to receive complex urinary diversions after radical cystectomy. Other 
related socioeconomic factors, especially patient education, may influence this 
practice pattern.

BACKGROUND: Enough data about health related quality of life (HRQOL) after 
radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion (UD) in women is still lacking. 
The objectives are to evaluate HRQOL in women after RC and orthotopic neobladder 
(ONB) versus ileal loop conduit (IC) and to assess the impact of urinary 
continence.
METHODS: The study included 145 women who underwent RC and came for routine 
follow-up. HRQOL was assessed by two questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30and FACT-Bl). 
ONB group was stratified to: totally continent, with nocturnal incontinence (NI) 
and patients in chronic urinary retention (CUR) and maintained on CIC. The 
orthotopic group (as a whole and its 3 subgroups) was compared to IC.
RESULTS: ONB group included 22 continent women, 35 with NI and 27 in CUR and on 
CIC. There were no statistically significant differences between ONB and IC 
groups in all domains of the two questionnaires. However, continent women showed 
statistically significant better most of EORTC-QLQ-C30 scales and emotional 
well-being, functional well-being, bladder cancer subscale and FACT-Bl total 
Score (P˂0.05) than IC group. Similarly, women in CUR showed statistically 
significant better global health and physical functioning EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores 
(P values=0.0001, 0.01) and all domains of FACT-Bl. On the other hand, women 
with NI showed statistically significant lower values in all domains of the 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 and FACT-Bl than IC group.
CONCLUSIONS: In women, HRQOL is better after ONB than IC as long as continence 
status is preserved. If incontinence is expected, IC may be a better option for 
UD.

PURPOSE: To describe a case of safe placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis 
reservoir for postoperative erectile dysfunction (ED) with a history of radical 
cystoprostatectomy with an orthotopic Studer neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 55-year-old bladder cancer patient, who underwent 
radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic Studer neobladder 2 years prior, 
suffered from postoperative ED. A 3-piece inflatable penile prosthesis was 
implanted via a penoscrotal incision. The alternative reservoir placement began 
with a longitudinal 4-cm incision, which was 2 finger-breaths to the left and 
lateral to the umbilicus. Thereafter, the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths 
were dissected and incised. Then, the transversalis fascia entering into the 
preperitoneal space was incised, followed by circumferential sweeping using the 
forefinger, and, finally, placement of a 100 mL 'flat' reservoir. The reservoir 
was filled with 65 mL saline and then evaluated for back pressure. The reservoir 
tubing exited through the defect of the rectus sheaths and tunneled through the 
abdominal fat into the penoscrotal wound.
RESULTS: Total operative time was 105 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 
minimal. The patient was discharged at postoperative day 1 and experienced no 
perioperative complications. At the 6-month follow-up, there was no abdominal 
bulging from the preperitoneal reservoir, and the reservoir was not palpable.
CONCLUSIONS: The preperitoneal placement of the flat reservoir at the level of 
the umbilicus is a safe and acceptable surgical technique for postoperative ED 
after radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic neobladder.

OBJECTIVES: To present our experience with a sigmoid orthotopic neobladder.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the functional and oncological outcomes of 
160 patients who underwent orthotopic neobladder reconstruction using a 
detubularized 20-25-cm sigmoid segment at our institution. Each patient was 
evaluated every 3 months the first year, every 6 months for the next 4 years and 
annually thereafter. Urodynamic studies of all consenting patients were carried 
out after 6 months, and 2, 5 and 10 years. We carried out the log-rank test, and 
used Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The anova test 
was used to compare urodynamic findings over time.
RESULTS: Mean follow up was 6.8 years (range 0.65-21.7 years). Overall survival 
was 58.1% at 5 years, and 47.1% at 10 years. Early complications occurred in 36 
patients (22.6%); late complications in 40 (25%). Stage V chronic kidney disease 
developed in two patients (1.3%). Complete (daytime and night-time) continence, 
defined as no need for pads or condom devices, was achieved by 45% of patients 
at 5 years, daytime continence was achieved by just 36% of patients; both were 
unchanged at 10 years. A significant difference emerged in maximal neobladder 
capacity and post-void residual values between 6 months and 2 years, and between 
2 and 5 years (P < 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Sigmoid neobladder continence and capacity significantly improve 
over the first 5 years, and they remain stable over the long term. Upper urinary 
tract function is not affected by endoluminal pressure, and the rate of 
metabolic imbalance is negligible.

neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy: A propensity score 
matching analysis.

Ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions are frequently performed after 
radical cystectomy. However, complications after radical cystectomy may be 
different according to the type of urinary diversion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) 
is a common complication after surgery and increases costs, morbidity, and 
mortality of hospitalized patients. This study was performed to compare the 
incidence of postoperative AKI between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary 
diversions after radical cystectomy.All consecutive patients who underwent 
radical cystectomy in 2004 to 2014 in a single tertiary care center were 
identified. The patients were divided into the ileal conduit and ileal 
neobladder groups. Preoperative variables, including demographics, 
cancer-related data and laboratory values, as well as intraoperative data and 
postoperative outcomes, including AKI, intensive care unit admission rate, and 
the duration of hospital stay, were evaluated between the groups. Postoperative 
AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome 
criteria. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to reduce the 
influence of possible confounding variables and adjust for intergroup 
differences.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the ileal conduit 
and ileal neobladder groups each included 101 patients. The overall incidence of 
AKI after radical cystectomy was 30.7% (62 out of 202) and the incidences did 
not significantly differ between the groups (27 [26.7%], ileal conduit group vs 
35 [34.7%], ileal neobladder group, P = 0.268). Intraoperative data, intensive 
care unit admission rate, and the duration of hospital stay were not 
significantly different between the groups.Postoperative AKI did not 
significantly differ between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions 
after radical cystectomy. This finding provides additional information useful 
for appropriate selection of the urinary diversion type in conjunction with 
radical cystectomy.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to report perioperative and oncological 
outcomes of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) in a single-center series 
and to evaluate the impact of the experience on perioperative outcomes.
METHODS: Between March 2012 and January 2016, 41 patients underwent RARC 
associated with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer. All RARC included were performed by a single-surgeon in one center. 
Perioperative and oncological datas were collected prospectively. 
Recurrence-free (RFS), overall (OS) and cancer-specific survivals (CSS) were 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Method. The impact of the experience on 
perioperative data was estimated using Spearman's correlation test.
RESULTS: Mean age was 67,7years (±10.6). Most patients underwent neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (73.2%). Mean operative time and mean estimated blood loss were 
respectively 319.5minutes (±85.3) and 662.5mL (±360.9). Eight patients needed 
perioperative blood transfusion (19.5%). Conversion to open surgery was 
necessary in 3 cases (7.3%). Ileal neobladder was performed in 26.8% of the 
cases (54.5% being performed intracorporeal), and non-continent urinary 
diversion in 73.2%. Mean nodal yield was 17.7 (±9.3). Positive surgical margins 
were observed in 1 patient (2.3%). Mean length of stay was 13.2 days (±9.8). 
Postoperative complication rate was 46,3%. After a median follow-up of 16months, 
estimated 2 year-OS and CSS were respectively 62 and 76.1%. Estimated 2-year RFS 
was 67.6%. Perioperative outcomes improved with experience with a significant 
decrease in operative time (P=0.04) and a significant increase of nodal yield 
(P=0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this single-center prospective study, satisfactory perioperative 
and oncological outcomes after RARC were observed despite the learning curve. 
Perioperative outcomes improved with surgeon's experience. Further studies are 
needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Women who undergo cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder are 
more likely to have urinary retention and neocystocele mainly because of 
anatomical reasons than stress urinary incontinence. The risk is even higher in 
case of neurologic comorbidities, as in case of our patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a laparoscopic mesh insertion for sacrospinal 
colposuspension to prevent a neocystocele and pelvic organ prolapse in 
combination with laparoscopic radical cystectomy in a female patient suffering 
from bladder cancer and chronic episodic multiple sclerosis. After a 30-month 
follow-up, the patient is continent and voids without residual urine. A dynamic 
MR of the pelvis shows a minimal rectocele without any evidence of a cystocele.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic cystectomy combined with sacrospinal mesh fixation is 
technically feasible and could be an option to prevent neocystocele for female 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the treatment of choice 
for invasive bladder cancer. Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome of 
surgery. This review compares the QOL after continent and incontinent urinary 
diversion in radical cystectomy for patients with primary invasive bladder 
cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies published 
after January 2000 was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Quality 
appraisal and data tabulation were performed using pre-determined forms. Data 
were synthesised by narrative review and random-effects meta-analysis using 
standardized response means. Heterogeneity and bias was assessed by Tau(2) and 
I(2) values and Funnel plots.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (3754 patients) were included for review. Pooled 
post-operative FACT and SF-36 scores showed no difference in overall QOL between 
continent and incontinent diversion (p = 0.31). Subgroup analysis demonstrated 
greater improvement in physical health for incontinent (p = 0.002) compared to 
continent diversions, but no differences in mental health (p = 0.35) and social 
health (p = 0.81). Qualitative analysis showed patients with neobladder had 
superior emotional function and body image compared to cutaneous diversion. QOL 
may improve to similar or better levels compared to baseline after 1 year, but 
data remains scarce. Patients report poor urinary and sexual function after 
surgery compared the general population. Long-term QOL is unclear. Levels of 
heterogeneity and bias were low.
CONCLUSIONS: QOL after radical cystectomy is comparable after either continent 
or incontinent urinary diversion. Post-operative QOL may improve, but urinary 
and sexual dysfunction remains inferior to the general population. Patient 
choice is key to selection of reconstruction method.

OBJECTIVES: To compare treatment-related outcomes of ureteral stenting with an 
external versus double J stent in patients with orthotopic reservoirs after 
radical cystectomy.
METHODS: Patients undergoing radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder were 
randomized into two groups; group I patients received external stents, whereas 
group II received double J stents. In both groups, preoperative parameters were 
recorded, and patients were assessed regarding urinary tract infection, urinary 
leakage, upper tract deterioration, readmission and hospital stay.
RESULTS: A total of 48 and 45 patients were randomized in the external stent 
group and double J group, respectively. Both groups were comparable in terms of 
age, sex, associated comorbidity and oncological status. Early urinary leak was 
observed in two patients (4.2%) in the external stent group, and in two patients 
(4.4%) in the double J group (P = 0.95). None of our patients developed ureteral 
strictures in the external stent group, and one patient did in the double J 
group (P = 0.3). Positive urine culture (58.3%, 51.1%) as well as febrile 
urinary tract infections (2.1%, 6.7%) were comparable between both groups, 
respectively (P = 0.43, 0.28). Wound complications (12.5%, 8.9%) and 
stent-related complications (2.1%, 0%) were comparable between both groups, 
respectively (P = 0.57, 0.33). The mean hospital stay was 17.5 days (range 14-32 
days) and 14.6 days (range 10-42 days) in both groups, respectively (P = 0.001), 
with comparable re-admission rates (P = 0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of double J stents in orthotopic urinary diversion is 
a safe alternative to the routinely used external stenting.

PURPOSE: We objectively quantified daytime and nocturnal continence rates, 
and defined predictive features for favorable continence outcomes after radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic ileal neobladder creation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 1 institution 1,012 cystectomies were performed 
between 2004 and 2015. Questionnaires evaluating the continence status were sent 
to 244 patients. To objectify postoperative urine loss daytime and nocturnal pad 
tests were performed. Continence was defined as the need for up to 1 safety pad 
and urine loss 10 gm or less per test. Predefined associative features were 
tested for an influence on continence outcomes. Statistical analysis was done 
with the Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests, and linear logistic regression 
models. Significance was considered at p <0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 188 patients (77.0%) returned the questionnaires. Median 
followup was 61 months. Median daytime pad use was 1 pad per day (range 0 to 9). 
Median daily urine loss based on standardized pad testing was 8 gm (range 0 to 
2,400). During the night a median of 1 pad (range 0 to 7) was used and median 
nocturnal urine loss was 28.5 gm (range 0 to 1,220). The continence rate was 
54.3% during the day and 36.3% at night. On multivariate analysis good 
preoperative ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) status (OR 2.987, 
p = 0.010), retained sensation of bladder filling (OR 6.462, p = 0.003) and 
preoperative coronary heart disease (OR 0.036, p = 0.002) were independent 
predictors of daytime success. Based on preoperative risk factors a simple 
predictive score for daytime continence was created (AUC 0.725, p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Continence rates after orthotopic ileal neobladder creation are 
lower than previously described when objective continence definitions are 
applied. Patients with good performance status, without coronary heart disease 
and with retained sensation of orthotopic ileal neobladder filling have better 
daytime continence outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy remains the referent treatment of 
non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The fast development of 
robotic surgery has led some teams to use it for the surgical treatment of the 
MIBC, in the hope of reducing postoperative morbidity. Urinary diversion by 
bladder substitution is a bypass option. The aim of our study was to compare the 
robot-assisted cystectomy with open cystectomy, with urinary diversion by 
bladder substitution.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a two-year period, all the patients who underwent a 
robot-assisted laparoscopic or open cystectomy with urinary diversion by bladder 
substitution have been included. The urinary diversion performed was 
extra-corporeal.
RESULTS: The study concerned were 26 men, 15 of them underwent robot-assisted 
cystectomy, and 11 open cystectomy. There was no significant difference in the 
median operating time or duration of stay (300 vs 314min and 14 vs 18 days). 
However, there were less blood loss and more lymph nodes collected in the 
cystectomies robot-assisted group (median: 400 vs 800mL, P=0.016; 15 vs 10, 
P=0.01). Three grade III complications of the Clavien-Dindo classification have 
been described in the robot-assisted group, and none in the open group. No 
robot-assisted procedure required a conversion to laparotomy. Within 90 
postoperative days, complications are basically low grades and results are 
consistent with the literature.
CONCLUSION: In our series, robot-assisted cystectomies with extracorporeal 
bladder substitution is technically feasible, with best results on blood loss 
and the number of lymph nodes removed, without impact on the length of stay.

PURPOSE: Assessing the unmet needs of cancer patients can help providers tailor 
health care services to patients' specific needs. This study examines whether 
the unmet informational and supportive care needs of the patients with 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer vary by the patients' age, sex, or individual 
treatment choices.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Participants (N = 30 survivors; 73.3% men) were recruited 
from the Mount Sinai Medical Center and through advertisements posted on a 
national Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network website between December 2011 and 
September 2012. Data were collected through individual interviews and electronic 
medical record review. A prior qualitative study of this cohort, using 
immersion/crystallization approach, confirmed the prevalence of unmet needs 
across the disease trajectory. This is a secondary quantitative analysis of the 
initial interview data we collected (i.e., quantitative analyses of transformed 
qualitative data using Chi-square and Fisher exact tests) to examine differences 
in unmet needs based on the patient's age, sex, and treatment choices.
RESULTS: Younger patients (<60y) were less satisfied with the treatment 
information received presurgery and more likely to report posttreatment 
complications, choose a neobladder, and seek and receive professional support 
regarding sexual function, than were older patients (P<0.05). More women than 
men reported difficulties with self-care and relied on themselves in disease 
self-management as opposed to relying on spousal support (P<0.05). Patients with 
neobladder were more likely to report difficulties with urinary incontinence and 
deterioration in sexual function, whereas patients with ileal conduit were more 
likely to require spousal help with self-care. Patients who received 
chemotherapy were significantly more likely to report changes in everyday life 
(P<0.05). Lastly, regardless of age, sex, or treatment choice, up to 50% of 
patients reported feeling depressed before or after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Unmet informational and supportive needs of patients with 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer during survivorship, and vary by age, sex, and 
treatment choices. Educational and psychological assessments as well as clinical 
interventions should be tailored to a patient's specific unmet needs, and to 
specific clinical and demographic characteristics.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the standard physical, chemical, and microscopic 
characteristics of urine in patients with noncomplicated orthotopic ileal 
neobladders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study that included 100 male 
patients who underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder between 1993 and 
2013. All included patients were in a good health and having satisfactory 
function of the reservoirs with normal upper tract with a minimum 1-year 
postoperative follow-up. We excluded patients with oncological failure, those 
with diversion-related complications, those who were maintained on clean 
intermittent catheterization, or those who have symptoms of urinary tract 
infection. Patients with medical diseases that may affect urine properties (eg, 
diabetes mellitus) or receiving special medications (eg, diuretics, alkali 
therapy, or antibiotics) were also excluded. The patients were subjected to 
urine analysis, blood chemistry, pH, and blood gases; the results were compared 
to a control group of 40 normal male volunteers.
RESULTS: Urine analysis in diverted patients showed higher urine pH than in 
control group but it is still acidic. Pyuria, proteinuria, hematuria, and 
positive culture were significantly higher in diverted patients. The chemical 
analysis showed lower urinary calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine contents in 
diverted patients than in the control group. Serum creatinine was significantly 
higher in diverted patients, whereas blood pH and bicarbonate were lower, but 
these values are within normal.
CONCLUSION: Urine from uncomplicated orthotopic ileal reservoirs is acidic. 
Pyuria, proteinuria, minor degrees of microscopic hematuria, and positive 
nitrite reaction are normal findings. We also have normal findings for lower 
urinary calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine contents in patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the serial changes of metabolic acidosis and identify 
associated risk factors in patients who underwent radical cystectomy and ileal 
neobladder.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2010 to August 2014, 123 patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder reconstruction for bladder 
cancer were included in this study. Metabolic acidosis was defined as a serum 
bicarbonate level less than 22 mEq/L and impaired renal function was defined as 
a GFR <50ml/min. The presence of metabolic acidosis was evaluated at 1 month, 1 
year, and 2 years after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
conducted to identify risk factors associated with development of metabolic 
acidosis.
RESULTS: Metabolic acidosis was observed in 52%, 19.5%, and 7.3% of patients at 
1 month, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery, respectively. At 1 month after 
surgery, impaired renal function was the only independent risk factor associated 
with metabolic acidosis (OR 3.87, P = 0.046). At 1 year after surgery, diabetes 
was the only independent risk factor associated with metabolic acidosis (OR 
5.68, P = 0.002). At 2 years post-surgery, both age and diabetes were 
significant risk factors associated with metabolic acidosis.
CONCLUSION: Approximately, half of patients experienced metabolic acidosis one 
month after ileal neobladder reconstruction. Preoperative impaired renal 
function was the most significant risk factor for developing metabolic acidosis 
in the early postoperative period. However, the incidence of metabolic acidosis 
decreased to less than 20% 1 year after surgery, and diabetes was an independent 
risk factor during this period.

Treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer with curative intent includes 
radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted 
a systematic review assessing differences in patient selection, operative 
parameters, complications, and quality of life between ileal conduit and 
neobladder cohorts. Ileal conduit cohorts have more advanced age and disease, 
more comorbidities and complications, and poorer quality of life. Ileal conduit 
surgery is associated with adverse patient selection that inhibits reasonable 
comparison of outcomes with neobladder cohorts. Despite this, we observe longer 
operative times and hospital stays in neobladder cohorts, perhaps reflecting 
greater technical difficulty and the need for postoperative bladder training.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common complications after 
radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. This study 
investigated the incidence and implicated pathogen of febrile UTI after ileal 
neobladder reconstruction and identify clinical and urodynamic parameters 
associated with febrile UTI. From January 2001 to May 2015, 236 patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder were included in this study. 
Fifty-five episodes of febrile UTI were identified in 46 patients (19.4%). The 
probability of febrile UTI was 17.6% and 19.8% at 6 months and 24 months after 
surgery, respectively. While, Escherichia coli was the most common implicated 
pathogen (22/55, 40.0%), Enterococcus spp. were the most common pathogen during 
the first month after surgery (18/33, 54.5%). In multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, ureteral stricture was an independent risk factor 
associated with febrile UTI (OR 5.93, P = 0.023). However, ureteral stricture 
accounted for only 6 episodes (10.9%, 6/55) of febrile UTI. Most episodes of 
febrile UTI occurred within 6 months after surgery. Thus, to identify risk 
factors associated with febrile UTI in the initial postoperative period, we 
assessed videourodynamics within 6 months after surgery in 38 patients. On 
videourodyamic examination, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was identified in 16 
patients (42.1%). The rate of VUR presence in patients who had febrile UTI was 
not significantly different from those in patients without febrile UTI (50% vs. 
39.3%, P = 0.556). Patients with febrile UTI had significantly larger residual 
urine volume (212.0 ± 193.7 vs. 90.5 ± 148.2, P = 0.048) than those without. E. 
coli and Enterococcus spp. are common pathogens and ureteral stricture and 
residual urine are risk factors for UTI after ileal neobladder reconstruction.

Neobladder “Belgrade pouch”: Metabolic consideration.

Bančević V, Aleksić P, Stamenković D, Pejčić T, Milović N, Kovačević B, Cerović 
S.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The ileal neobladder should be a lowpressure reservoir with 
acceptable volume and relatively small resorptive surface. A larger inner 
surface of the ileal pouch is associated with the high resorption of urine 
metabolites through intestinal mucosa and systemic metabolic disturbances, while 
a too small pouch results in a higher frequency of voiding and incontinency. The 
aim of this study was to investigate it is possible to create a neobladder from 
a shorter ileal segment compared to standard surgical techniques, and reduce 
metabolic complications.
METHODS: This prospective study included 77 male patients, scheduled for radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder derivation. The patients were divided into 
two groups: the standard pouch (SP) group of 37 patients scheduled for standard 
orthotopic neobladder, using a 50−70 cm long terminal ileum segment; the 
“Belgrade pouch” (BP) group of 40 patients scheduled for original, orthotopic 
urinary reservoir, using a 25−35 cm long terminal ileum segment. We measured 
neobladder capacity, acidosis, base excess and bicarbonate concentration in the 
postoperative month 3rd, 6th, 12th and 15th.
RESULTS: At the end of the study, the patients from the SP group had much higher 
neobladder capacity than the natural bladder − 750 mL (range 514−2,050 mL); in 
contrast, the patients from the BP group had average capacity of 438 mL (range 
205−653 mL) (p < 0.001). At the end of the study, there were more patients with 
acidosis (37.8% : 2.5%), base excess (35.1% : 7.5%) and low bicarbonate level 
(40.5% : 20.0%) in the SP group, than in the BP group, respectively (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: “Belgrade pouch”, make from 25−35 cm long terminal ileum segment may 
obtain adequate capacity and lower rate of metabolic disturbances than standard, 
high capacity orthotopic neobladders.

Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion are a challenge for patients. 
Requirements for the successful participation of the patient are sufficient 
urinary diversion management and recuperation/recovery as the result of 
urological rehabilitation. A social medical assessment reviews the individual 
oncological prognosis and the rehabilitation results to determine the return to

PURPOSE: We investigated oncologic and urinary outcomes after anterior 
exenteration for urothelial cell carcinoma in females, identifying tumor 
characteristics associated with female pelvic organ involvement. We hypothesized 
that a lack of trigonal or bladder floor tumor, intraoperative palpable 
posterior mass and clinical lymphadenopathy is associated with a lack of female 
pelvic organ involvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of female patients 
who underwent radical cystectomy at our institution from 1999 to 2014. Patient 
and operative characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record, 
and performance of hysterectomy was tested for association with disease 
recurrence. Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed with the 
chi-square and Student t-test, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to 
determine recurrence-free survival according to hysterectomy performance. Women 
who had neobladder creation were additionally evaluated for an association 
between hysterectomy status, and nighttime wetting and catheter use.
RESULTS: Of 322 eligible patients 160 with urothelial cancer did not have a 
hysterectomy before cystectomy. Mean followup was 2.2 years (SD 2.8). There were 
22 patients (13.8%) who had recurrence during followup. No patient or surgical 
factor other than use of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation (p <0.01) was 
associated with recurrence. Of 139 women 32 (23.0%) who underwent exenteration 
had female pelvic organ involvement. At least 1 of the 3 characteristics of 
interest were present in 28 of 99 (28.3%) women with any genitourinary organ 
involvement compared to only 4 of 40 (10.0%) of those who did not (p=0.01). 
Nighttime continence ranged between 21.9% and 48% but there was no significant 
association with continence and hysterectomy status.
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of trigonal/bladder floor tumor, palpable posterior mass and 
clinical lymphadenopathy is associated with the absence of pelvic organ 
involvement. Individualized risk assessment using these factors along with 
patient preferences should be used to guide surgical planning.

PURPOSE: To evaluate functional outcomes and patients' health-related quality of 
life over ten years after a W-shaped ileal neobladder urinary diversion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1994 to 2004, 87 patients with bladder cancer 
underwent a cystoprostatectomy with a W-shaped ileal neobladder. Among them, 31 
patients (35.6%) were evaluated. The average follow-up was 158months, average 
age was 72years. We assessed functional outcomes (use of protections, USP score, 
uroflowmetry, postvoid residual volume), overall health-related quality of life 
(SF-36 score), and specific urinary-related quality of life (Ditrovie scale).
RESULTS: Daytime continence was satisfactory in 29 patients (96.8%). Night-time 
continence was satisfactory in 27 patients (87.1%). Mean daytime continence, 
hyperactivity and dysuria scores of the USP were respectively 1.5/9, 3.2/21 and 
2/9. Mean value of the maximum flow rate was 18mL/s for an average voiding 
volume of 324mL and an average postvoid residual volume of 70mL. The 8 
dimensions of the SF-36 were all comparable with the French population's values. 
According to the Ditrovie scale whose average value was 1.83, the health-related 
quality of life was unchanged or little changed by urinary disorders in 28 
patients (90.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that voiding status and health-related quality 
of life remain satisfactory over ten years after an orthotopic ileal neobladder 
derivation.

Whyever bladder tissue engineering clinical applications still remain unusual 
even though many intriguing technological advances have been reached?

Alberti C.

To prevent problematic outcomes of bowel-based bladder reconstructive surgery, 
such as prosthetic tumors and systemic metabolic complications, research works, 
to either regenerate and strengthen failing organ or build organ replacement 
biosubstitute, have been turned, from 90s of the last century, to both 
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.Various types of acellular 
matrices, naturally-derived materials, synthetic polymers have been used for 
either "unseeded" (cell free) or autologous "cell seeded" tissue engineering 
scaffolds. Different categories of cell sources - from autologous differentiated 
urothelial and smooth muscle cells to natural or laboratory procedure-derived 
stem cells - have been taken into consideration to reach the construction of 
suitable "cell seeded" templates. Current clinically validated bladder tissue 
engineering approaches essentially consist of augmentation cystoplasty in 
patients suffering from poorly compliant neuropathic bladder. No clinical 
applications of wholly tissue engineered neobladder have been carried out to 
radical-reconstructive surgical treatment of bladder malignancies or chronic 
inflammation-due vesical coarctation. Reliable reasons why bladder tissue 
engineering clinical applications so far remain unusual, particularly imply the 
risk of graft ischemia, hence its both fibrous contraction and even worse 
perforation. Therefore, the achievement of graft vascular network 
(vasculogenesis) could allow, together with the promotion of host surrounding 
vessel sprouting (angiogenesis), an effective graft blood supply, so avoiding 
the ischemia-related serious complications.

OBJECTIVE: To describe our technique and outcomes of robotic-assisted 
nerve-sparing cystoprostatectomy with prostatic apex preservation and orthotopic 
ileal conduit urinary diversion in young men undergoing robotic-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC) for the management of urothelial carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Young men (<40 years old) with the diagnosis of 
urothelial carcinoma undergoing RARC with orthotopic neobaldder formation were 
eligible for our technique of nerve-sparing cystoprostatectomy with prostatic 
apex preservation at the time of orthotopic ileal conduit urinary diversion. 
During the apical prostatic dissection step of the RARC, the plane of dissection 
is directed under the dorsal vein complex and through anterior prostatic 
fibromuscular stroma. This plane is further carried through the prostatic 
urethra, transecting the most caudal aspect of prostatic peripheral zone 
posteriorly, to create a long urethra and a posterior urethral plate formed by 
peripheral zone of the prostate, which serves as a robust, long stump for the 
subsequent vesicourethral anastomosis.
RESULTS: From January 2013 to January 2014, 3 men were treated with RARC and 
intracorporeal neobladder urinary diversion based on the described technique. 
There were no intraoperative complications. Two patients experienced grade II 
complications postoperatively. Pathologic assessment demonstrated negative 
surgical margins in all 3 cases. With mean follow-up time of 28.2 months, 2 out 
of 3 patients are free from disease recurrence. All patients report daytime 
urinary continence with no pad usage and potency without the need for 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: RARC with bilateral nerve and apical preservation can be performed 
safely in appropriately selected young patients with excellent functional and 
acceptable short-term oncologic results.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term functional, urodynamic, and metabolic 
outcomes of our modified neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study from January 2010 to October 
2014, 42 consecutive male patients with bladder tumor underwent radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion with modified ileal neobladder using 
25 cm ileal segment. During follow-up, functional outcome, urodynamic studies, 
metabolic parameters, and renal parameters were assessed at regular intervals. 
Complications were graded as early (<3 months) or late (>3 months).
RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. At a mean follow-up of 27.2 months, 
good or satisfactory daytime and nighttime continence were achieved in 100% and 
93.8% of patients, respectively. Mean maximal bladder capacity was 588 mL at 3 
years. Mean resting pressure and voiding pressures were 20.1 cm H2O and 34.6 cm 
H2O at 3 years, respectively. Good bladder compliance was achieved in all 
patients by 1 year. Mean maximum urine flow rate (Qmax) was 18.5 mL at 3 years. 
Postvoid residual volume was insignificant in all the patients and none of the 
patients were on clean intermittent self-catheterization. None of the patients 
developed severe metabolic acidosis. Vitamin B12 levels were within normal range 
in all patients. Early complications were seen in 12 patients (28.6%), whereas 
late complications were observed in 5 patients (12%).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that our modified technique of using a short 
ileal segment to create a near-spherical, compliant, low-pressure reservoir 
provides an acceptable, safe, and functional alternative to the standard 
Hautmann neobladder.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the difference at different steps of follow-up of the 
postoperative quality of life (QoL) in patients who had undergone radical 
cystectomy and ileal orthotopic neobladder derivation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentric, cross-qualitative study was performed in 5 
Italian centers of reference for the treatment of bladder cancer. One hundred 
seventy one patients who underwent radical cystectomy and creation of ileal 
orthotopic neobladder according to 'Vescica Ileale Padovana' between 2006 and 
2011 have been analyzed. The validated and dedicated questionnaires EORTC 
QLQ-C30, IOB-PRO and EORTC QLQ-BLM30 were used.
RESULTS: All data gathered were then processed, specifically means ± SD were 
included for comparison during 4 periods of follow-up (quartile): the first 
ranging from 1 to 18 months; the second ranging from 19 to 36 months; the third 
from 37 to 72 months and the fourth >72 months. Cancer-specific and 
health-related factors were analyzed separately, and the change was determined 
during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The global QoL, highlighted by validated cancer-specific and 
health-related questionnaires, is certainly on a satisfactory level. Thus, the 
education of the patient, the exploration of the pros and cons of an orthotopic 
neobladder and the active participation in treatment decision seem to be the 
keys to better improve the post-operative QoL during the follow-up period.

The study aims to review the current evidence for quality of life posturinary 
diversion surgery comparing neobladder to other types of diversion. A review of 
literature from inception to July 2015 for all English-language articles was 
done. Based on our inclusion criteria, 22 studies (2450 patients) were included. 
Whereas none of the prospective studies showed any quality of life (QoL) 
advantage with ileal conduit diversion, 3 of the 5 prospective studies and 4 of 
the 6 studies published after 2011 show better QoL outcomes with neobladder than 
other urinary diversion types. All prospective studies published after 2011 have 
shown neobladder to have superior QoL outcomes than its comparators. Recent 
trends indicate that orthotopic neobladder postcystectomy is associated with 
better QoL outcomes compared to other urinary diversion types.

To investigate the clinical applications of robot-assisted radical cystectomy 
with orthotopic ileal neobladder (RARC-INB) and make a preliminary summary. 
Retrospective analysis the clinical data of 12 patients underwent robotic 
bladder cancer (da vinci surgical system) assisted laparoscopic cystectomy with 
ileal orthotopic neobladder from March 2015 to April 2015. 12 cases were 
successful, with no surgical intervention, and organ damage occurred. The 
operation time was 330~470 min, which average (390.0±61.5) min; blood loss was 
90~870 ml, which average (185.0±88.3) ml. One case of intraoperative blood 
transfusion was 400 ml. The enjoin eating time of postoperative intestinal 
ventilation was 3~6 d, and the average time was (4.0±1.5) d. Removal of ureteral 
stents time was 14~28 d and the average time was (21±7) d. Removal of the 
catheter time was 18~28 d and the average time was (23±5) d. Postoperative 
hospital stay 19~29 d and the average time was (24±5) dRARC-INB make the 
surgical tends to simplify, which was conducive to surgeon intraoperative 
control and assurance. RARC-INB make the surgical tends to use less trauma, less 
bleeding, complete lymphadenectomy, quick recovery, etc. It is a safe, effective 
and reliablethe method in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. So the 
method should be widely applied.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing life-threatening complications 
during perioperative period in patients undergoing traditional cystectomy with 
orthotopic neobladder.
METHODS: To retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 206 cases who underwent 
radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder. Logistic regression analysis was 
used to analyze the significance of the factors such as age, amount of bleeding, 
pathological stage, effective supplement of albumin, cardiovascular disease, 
diabetes mellitus, operation duration, intestinal preparation, etc., on the 
occurrence of severe complications.
RESULTS: Among the 206 patients who underwent radical cystectomy with orthotopic 
neobladder, 22 cases (10.7%) had life-threatening complications (intestinal 
fistula, hemorrhagic shock, severe infection) during the perioperative period, 
and 9 cases died (mortality rate 4.4%). Logistic regression analysis showed that 
the elderly age, long operation duration, lack of effective supplement of 
albumin, diabetes mellitus are independent factors influencing the occurrence of 
life-threatening complications during the perioperative period of radical 
cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder (P<0.05 for all), and are risk 
factors positively correlated with the severe complications.
CONCLUSION: The elderly age, long operation duration, lack of effective 
supplement of albumin, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors of the occurrence 
of life-threatening complications during the perioperative period in patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder, therefore, 
attention should be paid to this issue.

Secondary perineal herniation of intraperitoneal contents represents a rare 
complication following procedures such as abdominoperineal rectal resection or 
cystectomy. We present a case of a perineal hernia formation with prolapse of an 
ileum neobladder following radical cystectomy and rectal resection for recurrent 
bladder cancer. Following consecutive resections in the anterior and posterior 
compartment of the lesser pelvis, the patient developed problems emptying his 
neobladder. Clinical examination and computed tomography revealed perineal 
herniation of his neobladder through the pelvic floor. Through a perineal 
approach, the hernial sac could be repositioned, and via a combination of 
absorbable and non-absorbable synthetic mesh grafts, the pelvic floor was 
stabilised. Follow-up review at one year after hernia fixation showed no signs 
of recurrence and no symptoms. In cases of extensive surgery in the lesser 
pelvis with associated weakness of the pelvic compartments, meshes should be 
considered for closure of the pelvic floor. Development of biological meshes 
with reduced risk of infection might be an interesting treatment option in these 
cases.

Orthotopic neobladder is an attractive alternative to the ileal conduit 
following radical cystectomy. Robotic cystectomy is gaining popularity although 
the uptake of neobladder reconstruction is low, with the majority of cases being 
constructed extracorporeally via a mini-laparotomy. Minimally invasive 
cystectomy using the robotic platform facilitates intracorporeal neobladder 
reconstruction and several techniques have been described. This review discusses 
issues relating to patient selection, and describes existing techniques of open 
surgical neobladder reconstruction and their evolution to suit an intracorporeal 
approach. A Medline search for publications from January 1970 to September 2015 
with the following keyword search criteria was performed: radical cystectomy, 
robotic cystectomy, intracorporeal, neobladder, orthotopic bladder 
reconstruction, surgical technique, patient selection and ureteric-ileal 
anastomosis.

Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is a common urological procedure 
performed for the treatment of bladder cancer. Numerous surgical procedures have 
been developed for urinary diversion. Over the past decade, orthotopic 
neobladder reconstruction has been used frequently for urinary diversion because 
of its advantageousness in providing patients with a good quality of life 
compared with other urinary diversion technique. Knowledge of the indication, 
surgical procedure, and postsurgical anatomy of orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction is essential. While the technique has many advantages, multiple 
postsurgical complications may occur after reconstruction, including urine 
leakage, bowel obstruction and fluid collection (lymphocele, urinoma, hematoma, 
and abscess), neobladder rupture, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, urinary 
tract infection, urinary calculi, abdominal incisional hernia, bowel 
obstruction, intraneobladder tumor, and tumor recurrence. Radiological imaging 
including multiple modalities such as intravenous urography, cystography, CT, 
and MRI plays an important role in the postoperative evaluation of patients with 
orthotopic neobladder reconstruction and is an accurate method for evaluating 
complications. In addition, knowledge of appearances on multimodal imaging helps 
clinicians to select the modality required to achieve an accurate diagnosis of 
each complication and avoid misdiagnosis.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is considered one of the most lethal 
malignancies with high metastatic potential. Usually, metastatic bladder cancer 
carries worse prognosis with a median survival rate of approximately 6 months, 
which can be prolonged for up to 14 months with palliative systemic 
chemotherapy. We present the case of a 61-year-old male patient diagnosed with 
localized MIBC 10 years ago. He underwent nerve-sparing radical cystectomy with 
ileal neobladder, but developed pulmonary metastatic disease 7 months 
postoperatively. Six cycles of gemcitabine/cisplatin combination chemotherapy 
with an addition of gefitinib as daily oral medication were administered within 
a randomized phase II clinical trial; this resulted in complete remission of the 
pulmonary metastases. Until now, the patient is still on gefitinib daily without 
any side effects. Although, the addition of gefitinib to standard systemic 
chemotherapy has not been shown to improve the survival in metastatic urothelial 
cancer, this case represents a very pleasant albeit uncommon long-term outcome.

PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the functional outcomes of ileal and sigmoid 
neobladders in patients underwent radical cystectomy.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, and 
Cochrane Library. The studies comparing the functional outcomes of sigmoid 
neobladder (SN) and ileal neobladder (IN) in patients underwent radical 
cystectomy were included.
RESULTS: A total of 12 cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. From 
our analysis, more early complications were observed in SN group than in IN 
group (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03-1.81). Both daytime and nighttime continence 
rates were significantly better in IN group than in SN group (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 
0.81-0.94) (RR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.60-0.90). More patients could spontaneous 
voiding in SN group than in IN group (RR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.00-1.26). According to 
the urodynamic study, ileal neobladder exhibited bigger capacity (WMD = -84.93, 
95%CI: -160.36 to -9.50), lower pressure at capacity (WMD = 11.18, 95%CI: 
4.29-18.06), better compliance (WMD = -25.55, 95%CI: -32.45 to -18.64), and 
greater post-void residual volume(WMD = -23.48, 95%CI: -36.75 to -10.21); There 
was no significant difference in the max voiding flow rate or void volume 
between the two groups (WMD = -1.00, 95%CI: -3.73-1.73) (WMD = -27.00, 95%CI: 
70.05-16.06). No significant difference was found in the serum creatinine 
between the two groups (WMD = -0.05, 95%CI: -0.12-0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Ileal neobladder seems able to provide more favorable patient's 
satisfaction, while sigmoid neobladder may provide a better chance of 
spontaneous voiding. This meta-analysis may provide some useful evidences for 
urological surgeons to choose the ideal bladder substitute for patients 
underwent radical cystectomy.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published 
in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a 
description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant 
literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The 
goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the 
results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical 
Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.A 64-year-old man with 
a history of cigarette smoking but no significant comorbidities presented with 
hematuria and dysuria. Computed tomography scans demonstrated a mass and 
thickening of the bladder wall and no evidence of metastasis. His laboratory 
evaluation showed normal blood cell counts and comprehensive metabolic panel 
with a calculated creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL per minute. A 
transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and biopsy identified transitional 
cell carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma invading the muscularis propria of the 
bladder. On the basis of the bladder-confined mass on computed tomography scan, 
the tumor was assigned a clinical stage of cT2N0. The patient was advised to 
undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy (RC). The 
patient had multiple concerns regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly 
toxicities, especially the possibility of chronic neurologic and renal 
toxicities, and the potential harm from delay of RC, especially if the bladder 
cancer was resistant to chemotherapy. After a discussion of approximately 1 
hour, he elected to proceed with upfront RC and extended lymph node dissection 
in conjunction with construction of a neobladder. Pathology revealed pathologic 
extravesical urothelial carcinoma, with disease in one of 25 lymph nodes removed 
(ypT3N1). Four weeks after RC, he returned to discuss further management with 
the medical oncologist. He exhibited an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0, normal blood cell counts, and a calculated creatinine 
clearance of more than 60 mL per minute.

AIMS: To present the long term-results and complications of a large series of 
stapled ileal orthotopic neobladders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1992 to 2012 we performed 606 radical cystectomies 
with stapled orthotopic neobladder substitution in male patients. The median 
patient age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58-71).
RESULTS: Median operative time was 205 min (IQR: 180-225). The overall survival 
rates at 5, 10, 15, and 20 yr were 68% (336 of 494), 55% (207 of 376), 38% (98 
of 259), and 23% (14 of 62), respectively, and the disease specific survival 
rates were 75% (371 of 494), 59% (222 of 376), 50% (130 of 259), and 35% (22 of 
62), respectively. After a median follow-up of 81 months (IQR: 30-144), a total 
of 147 early (less than 90 days) complications (38 diversion related, 109 
diversion unrelated) occurred in 144 patients (24%); 163 late complications (141 
diversion related, 22 diversion unrelated) affected 141 patients (23%). At 60 
months, daytime and nighttime continence was complete in 96% and 72% of cases, 
respectively. Urodynamic studies showed that maximum capacity, residual volume, 
maximum flow rate, pressure at maximum capacity, and maximum outlet closure 
pressure were not statistically different at 12 and 60 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a stapler when performing orthotopic neobladders 
significantly reduces the operating time, and offers good functional results 
with acceptable complication rates. Our results could encourage the use of a 
stapler when performing an ileal neobladder during laparoscopic and robotic 
radical cystectomies.

PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy 
of conventional and ambulatory urodynamic studies (UDS) in estimating neobladder 
function.
METHODS: We evaluated 32 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and 
orthotopic Hautmann W neobladder with Abol-Enein-Ghoneim uretero-intestinal 
anastomosis for bladder cancer. The patients were initially examined by using 
both conventional and ambulatory UDS.
RESULTS: Conventional UDS detected a very high mean intravesical pressure at 
maximum capacity (53.7±17.5 cm H2O). By contrast, the mean intravesical pressure 
detected by using ambulatory UDS (which reflects the dominant pattern of 
pressure variation during filling) was significantly lower (34.4±5.2 cm H2O, 
P<0.001). The comparison between intravesical pressure at half of maximum 
capacity in conventional UDS and the mean value in ambulatory UDS did not show 
significant difference (P=0.152). The mean voided volume in conventional UDS was 
greater than both the mean voided volume (P<0.001) and the mean maximum voided 
volume in ambulatory UDS (P=0.001). However, this difference did not affect the 
postvoid residual urine volume measured in both studies (P=0.207). Moreover, 
incontinence episodes recorded in ambulatory UDS were more frequent but not 
statistically significantly different from those recorded in conventional UDS 
(P=0.332).
CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of neobladder function by means of ambulatory UDS 
seems to provide interesting research data for the mode of lower urinary tract 
function in patients with orthotopic substitution after radical cystectomy. The 
great high value in ambulatory UDS, in cases in which conventional UDS had 
failed, is due to the exposure of daily and nocturnal incontinence episodes, 
confirming our patients' complaints.

[Metabolic acidosis in a patient with an orthotopic neobladder].

[Article in Polish]

Migacz M, Holecki M, Strzałkowska D, Duława J.

We present a case of 62-year-old patient after cystectomy with intestinal 
neobladder due to bladder cancer, complicated by severe acid-balance 
disturbances. Due to poor clinical condition and metabolic acidosis patient 
temporarily required renal replacement therapy. After obtaining the stabile 
clinical status the patient was discharged with the recommendation of chronic 
oral treatment with the alkalizing agents and regular blood gas control. In the 
6 month follow-up there were neither symptoms of uremia nor significant 
abnormalities in waterelectrolyte balance.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer represents one of the ten most prevalent cancers 
worldwide. More than 400,000 people worldwide are newly diagnosed every year. 
Within 2 years after diagnosis, 80% of patients with muscle invasive bladder 
cancer without treatment die.
METHODS: The aggressive local surgical approach with a cystectomy is the therapy 
of choice. The median age of patients with de novo bladder cancer is 70 years. 
Thus bladder cancer is a cancer of the elderly. For demographical reasons, the 
number of eldery patients undergoing radical cystectomy will rise in the next 
few years. The type of urinary diversion is a major factor influencing 
perioperative morbidity and quality of life in these patients. Incontinent 
urinary diversions are preferentially used in daily practice.
CONCLUSIONS: There are only a few contraindications for orthotopic neobladder; 
however, age alone is not a contraindication. Patient selection and a nerve 
sparing approach are crucial in men and women to achieve excellent functional 
results with orthotopic neobladder in elderly patients.

PURPOSE: The optimal form of urinary diversion following radical cystectomy 
remains controversial. We sought to compare the long-term health-related 
quality-of-life outcomes between patients with orthotopic neobladder and ileal 
conduit diversion (ICD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 95 patients following radical cystectomy and 
ICD (n = 49) or orthotopic neobladder reconstruction (ONR) (n = 46), with a 
minimum interval of 1 year from surgery. All patients completed the Bladder 
Cancer Index questionnaire, assessing their urinary, bowel, and sexual function, 
and bother scores.
RESULTS: Patients treated with ONR were generally younger and healthier compared 
with those who underwent ICD (P<0.01). Sex, marital status, disease status at 
the time of enrollment, and mean duration elapsing from surgery to interview 
were similar between the subgroups. Better functional scores in favor of ICD 
were recorded in the urinary domain (P<0.01), whereas the corresponding bother 
scores were roughly identical in both groups. Conversely, although higher 
functional scores were recorded in the sexual domain of patients with ONR 
(P<0.01), the corresponding bother scores in this group were lower compared with 
their counterparts with ICD (53.2 vs. 65.3; P<0.05). As patients grew older they 
were more likely to report on better urinary function and worse sexual function, 
but were less likely to be bothered by the decline in sexual function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the bother resulting from urinary 
incontinence and the risk of sexual dysfunction be highlighted to those electing 
for neobladder reconstruction, whereas patients preferring conduit diversion 
should be reassured that their expected quality of life is not compromised.

PURPOSE: The current literature on the impact of different urinary diversions on 
patients' health related quality of life (HR-QoL) showed a marginally better 
quality of life scores of orthotopic neobladder (ONB) compared to ileal conduit 
(IC). The aim of this study was to update the review of all relevant published 
studies on the comparison between ONB and IC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified by searching multiple literature 
databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PubMed Data were 
synthesized using meta-analytic methods conformed to the PRISMA statement.
RESULTS: The current meta-analysis was based on 18 papers that reported a HR-QoL 
comparison between IC and ONB using at least a validate questionnaire. Pooled 
effect sizes of combined QoL outcomes for IC versus ONB showed a slight, but not 
significant, better QoL in patients with ONB (Hedges' g = 0.150; p = 0.066). 
Patients with ileal ONB showed a significant better QoL than those with IC 
(Hedges' g = 0.278; p = 0.000); in case series with more than 65% males, ONB 
group showed a slight significant better QoL than IC (Hedges' g = 0.190; 
p = 0.024). Pooled effects sizes of all EORTC-QLQ-C30 aspects showed 
a significant better QoL in patients with ONB (Hedges' g = 0.400; p = 0.0000).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of not-randomized comparative studies on the 
impact of different types of urinary diversions on HR-QoL showed demonstrated a 
significant advantage of ileal ONB compared to IC in terms of HR-QoL.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) is an important consideration 
after radical cystectomy (RC). Lack of effective ways to assess HRQoL after RC 
and unawareness of disease-specific problems related to ileal conduit (IC) and 
orthotopic ileal neobladder (OIN) are serious problems. The present study was to 
evaluate and compare morbidity and HRQoL between IC and OIN after RC, and 
examine their unmet needs in the two groups.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 294 patients treated with RC in 
our hospital between 2007 and 2013. Matched pair analysis was used to determine 
the patients of IC and OIN groups. Patient HRQoL between IC and OIN groups was 
assessed using the bladder-specific bladder cancer index (BCI) and European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Body Image scale (BIS) 
questionnaires. Unmet information of patients undergoing these two urinary 
diversions was recorded through individual interviews.
RESULTS: Of the 117 included patients, 39 patients were treated with OIN and the 
other 78 matched patients with IC as controls for matched pair analysis. There 
was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the two 
groups. OIN patients showed significantly better BIS scores in terms of HRQoL 
outcomes after RC at a short-term (<1 year) follow-up level, but there was no 
significant difference at a long-term (>1 year) follow-up level between the two 
groups. Interestingly, urinary bother (UB) and urinary function (UF) were poor 
in OIN patients at the one-year follow-up level, but there was no significant 
difference in UB between the two groups at the long term follow-up level. Unmet 
needs analysis showed that OIN patients had a more positive attitude towards 
treatment and participated in physical and social activities more positively, 
although they may have more urine leakage problems.
CONCLUSIONS: The mean BIS score in OIN group patients was significantly better 
than that in IC group patients at the one-year follow-up level, but there was no 
significant difference at the long-term follow-up level. Due attention should be 
paid to some particular unmet needs in individual patients in managing the two 
UD modalities.

BACKGROUND: Totally intracorporeal robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) 
has perceived difficulties compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC). As the 
technique is increasingly adopted around the world, the benefits of RARC with 
intra- or extracorporeal urinary diversion or ORC for the patients are still 
unclear. In this article, we consider the current evidence for this issue.
METHODS: We assessed two questions through using expert opinion and the medical 
literature: (A) Is RARC better than ORC for removing the cancer surgery and 
outcome? (B) Is RARC better than ORC for the urinary diversion?
OUTCOMES: (A) RARC is better than ORC for shorter length of stay, blood loss and 
complication rates. (B) Intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder may have a 
significant physiological and surgical benefit to the patient recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: RARC with total intracorporeal reconstruction has potential 
benefits to the patient. We recommend that all surgeons document patient-related 
outcome measures, urodynamics and enhanced recovery protocols for cystectomy 
patients to help us understand the real improvements within bladder cancer 
surgery and reconstruction.

Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India.

INTRODUCTION: This study was aimed at analyzing the need for routine use of 
frozen section analysis (FSA) before performing orthotopic neobladder (ONB) 
after radical cystectomy for carcinoma urinary bladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 233 patients underwent radical cystectomy from 
January 2000 to June 2013. Of these, 151 (65.6%) patients were planned for ONB. 
In the initial 109 (72%) patients, FSA of urethral margin was performed, but, in 
the subsequent 42 (28%) patients, frozen section of urethral margin was not 
sent. Impact of hydroureteronephrosis, tumor size and location of tumor in 
relation to the bladder neck on the status of the urethral margin was analyzed.
RESULTS: Only three of the 109 (2.7%) patients had a positive urethral margin. 
Two of them had ileal conduit and one, after negative re-resection, had ONB. 
Although none of the factors was found to be significant, all three patients 
with a positive urethral margin had growth at the bladder neck and died of 
cancer at a mean follow up of 29.33 ± 18.3 months, without urethral recurrence. 
Among the negative FSA (106), two patients had recurrence in the penile urethra. 
The mean follow-up was 46.3 ± 25.1 months. None of the patients without FSA (42) 
had urethral recurrence at the mean follow-up of 36 ± 9.3 months. Of the 28 
patients who had their growth located at the bladder neck, three had positive 
FSA, while none with growth away from the bladder neck had positive FSA.
CONCLUSION: Routine FSA of the urethra before performing ONB can be avoided in 
those patients where the tumor does not reach the bladder neck.

INTRODUCTION: Muscle invasive bladder cancer is an unforgiving disease, and if 
untreated, it leads to death within 2 years of the diagnosis in >85 % of the 
patients. Long-term oncologic efficacy remains the ultimate standard that all 
procedures have to be measured by. In the past decades, open radical cystectomy 
(RC), extended pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), and urinary diversion have 
been established as the gold standard. In the last few years, however, growing 
attention has been set on robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
RESULTS: Even in the very long term, open RC has good oncological results and if 
an ileal neobladder is performed excellent functional results. Follow-up of 
patients after open RC exceeds more than a decade which is unsurpassed by any 
other technique. Its outcomes have been proven to be durable and cost-effective. 
Least perioperative complications as well as best oncological and functional 
results can be achieved if open RC and urinary diversion were performed in a 
high-volume hospital by high-volume surgeons and an experienced team.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite upcoming new technologies such as RARC, open RC following 
extended (PLND) remains the gold standard treatment for high-grade muscle 
invasive bladder cancer.

Cystectomy and urinary diversion (Bricker ileal conduit or neobladder) are 
common modalities of care in urology requiring their attention. Oncological 
surgery as well as functional disorders in particular for neurogenic bladder are 
the main directions. The optimal decision must be multidisciplinary and requires 
the fundamental of stomatherapy that urology teams need to know in order to 
improve the management of the care plan. After cystectomy whose surgical 
approach depends on the cause (oncological vs other causes), urinary diversions 
may be non continent (cutaneous ureterostomy or Bricker ileal conduit) or 
continent (ileal neobladder most of the time.) The monitoring and patient's 
support remain two most important steps, particularly in cases of bladder 
diversion to monitor (protection of upper urinary tract, neobladder capacity) 
and patient education (learning of continence and good emptying). The choice of 
many surgical techniques must be adapted to the characteristics of the patient, 
after an informed discussion with the patient.

Orthotopic urinary diversion.

Daneshmand S(1).

Author information:
(1)USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, USC Institute of Urology, Los 
Angeles, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Orthotopic urinary diversion has been performed for more than 
30 years. Although it is considered to be the gold standard form of diversion in 
many centers of expertise, however it is uncommonly performed outside these 
institutions. The purpose of this article is to review the current indications 
and outcomes of orthotopic diversion with a focus on male patients and to 
explore potential barriers to wider dissemination of the technique.
RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 75% of patients undergoing radical cystectomy 
today are candidates for orthotopic diversion and in the absence of absolute 
contraindications, very few patients chose to undergo an ileal conduit for 
personal reasons. In a recent quality of life study, the orthotopic neobladder 
was better than ileal conduit in terms of global health status and physical 
functioning. In a prospective randomized trial comparing a refluxing versus 
nonrefluxing neobladder, there was no difference in renal function after 3 
years. There is currently insufficient evidence to suggest improved 
perioperative outcomes with the use of minimally invasive techniques.
SUMMARY: There are very few absolute contraindications for an orthotopic 
neobladder, which remains the gold standard form of diversion at many centers of 
expertise. Surgeon experience and thorough preoperative counseling with 
realistic expectations can ensure optimal outcomes and patient satisfaction.

INTRODUCTION: Age is an established risk factor for developing bladder cancer 
and is associated with increased stage and worse treatment outcomes. 
Furthermore, elderly patients who require radical cystectomy are more likely to 
undergo an incontinent urinary diversion compared with younger patients.
METHODS: To evaluate whether evidence exists to support performing an orthotopic 
neobladder in the elderly, we reviewed the literature to identify studies 
reporting outcomes, complications, patient-selection criteria, and 
quality-of-life data on elderly patients who underwent orthotopic neobladder 
following radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: While age was shown to be a risk factor for complications following 
orthotopic neobladder, similar complication rates were reported between those 
who received either an orthotopic neobladder or ileal conduit when compared 
within age groups. Additionally, in properly selected elderly patients, similar 
outcomes and quality of life can be expected when compared with younger 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: It is appropriate to offer an orthotopic neobladder to 
well-selected elderly patients following radical cystectomy.

California.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the occurrence and cost burden of hospital readmission 
within 90 days of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). Subjects/Patients 
(or Materials) and Methods: From 2003 to 2012, 247 patients underwent RARC with 
extracorporeal urinary reconstruction at a single categorical cancer hospital. 
Continent diversions were performed in 67% of patients. All readmissions within 
90 days were included. Readmissions were defined as early (<30 days) and late 
(31-90 days) with multiple readmissions captured as separate events. Cost 
analysis was performed using average direct hospital cost. The Fisher exact test 
was used to determine differences in proportion of readmissions between patient 
groups, while logistic regression was used to identify predictors for 
readmission.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight (40%) patients were readmitted to the hospital at least 
once within 90 days after RARC, of which 77% occurred within 30 days. 
Twenty-seven (11%) required two or more readmissions. Readmissions took place at 
a median of 13 days after initial discharge. The most common reasons for initial 
readmission were infections (41%) and dehydration (19%). Stratified by urinary 
reconstruction type, ileal conduit (dehydration), Indiana pouch (urinary-tract 
infection without sepsis), and Studer neobladder (sepsis and pelvic abscess) 
differed by readmission reason. In a multivariable analysis, estimated blood 
loss was a predictor for readmission (p = 0.05). Patients readmitted to the 
hospital had direct costs that were 1.42× those who did not require readmission. 
Readmissions for ileus contributed to the highest cost of readmission, although 
ureteral stricture, pelvic abscess, and sepsis were the most costly per day of 
hospitalization. Limitations include retrospective analysis as well as variable 
thresholds for readmission and costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital readmission rates after RARC are high and costs of 
readmission are significant. Most patients are readmitted within 30 days and 
infection and dehydration are common causes. Clinicians should be aware of 
diversion-specific readmission causes.

OBJECTIVE: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the standard treatment for muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer. Postoperative complications are reported to be as high as 65%. 
The objective of this study was to investigate complications and survival in 
Icelandic patients with bladder cancer who underwent RC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who had bladder cancer and underwent RC in 
Iceland from 2003 to 2012 were included. Information was obtained 
retrospectively from patients' medical records and from the Icelandic Cause of 
Death Registry. Complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo 
classification system. The Kaplan-Meier method was used in the survival 
analysis. Only patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) were included in 
the survival analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 108 patients (male 81%, median age 68 years) underwent the 
procedure during the study period and 100 of them had TCC. Ileal conduit was 
performed in 86% of procedures and orthotopic neobladder in 14%. The median 
operation time was 266 min and the median blood loss during the procedure was 
1000 ml. No patient died within 30 days of surgery, but one patient (0.9%) died 
within 90 days of surgery from complications of the surgery. Complications were 
reported for 62 patients (57%) overall. Major complications (Clavien 3-5) were 
reported in 32 patients (29%), and 30 patients (28%) had only minor 
complications (Clavien 1-2). Twenty-four patients (22%) had to undergo 
reoperation. Overall 5 year survival was 54%.
CONCLUSION: Morbidity after RC is high but similar to that seen in other 
studies. Long-term survival of Icelandic patients is comparable to that in 
neighboring countries.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate if use of an ileal 
conduit (IC) versus a neobladder (NB) during radical cystectomy (RC) can play a 
role in the morbidity of the surgical procedure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2001 our institution has prospectively maintained a 
database of more than 500 patients who have undergone RC. The records of 258 
patients who received an RC and IC and 121 who received an RC and NB were 
reviewed for the present study. Using a binary logistic regression model a 
propensity score was generated for the following factors: sex, age, smoking 
habit, Charlson score, American Society of Anesthesiology score, preoperative 
hydronephrosis, and pathologic T stage. Two groups of patients with similar 
propensity scores were created with a ratio of 1:1, one group who received an IC 
and another who received an NB. The following features were compared between the 
2 groups: blood loss, intraoperative complication rate, time to oral intake 
resumption, postoperative complication rate (overall, Clavien classification 
1-2, Clavien classification 3-5, related to RC, related to urinary 
reconstruction).
RESULTS: In total, 170 patients were selected; 85 with NB, 85 with IC, and the 2 
groups were well matched according to the desired features. No differences were 
noted for all of the compared features.
CONCLUSION: The morbidity of RC does not seem to be affected by the choice of IC 
versus NB.

BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma of the transitional epithelium is the most 
common malignancy in the Thai kidney transplant population.
METHODS: We report our experience in managing simultaneous upper and lower 
urinary tract urothelial cancer in a post-kidney transplant recipient through 
the use of laparoscopic bilateral nephron-ureterectomy and anterior pelvic 
exenteration with the use of a Studer orthotopic neobladder. A 35-year-old woman 
with end-stage renal disease underwent living related kidney transplantation in 
2009. She presented with gross hematuria 5 years later. Enhanced computer 
tomography revealed diffuse bladder wall thickening with an intravesical 
polypoid soft tissue mass at the right ureterovesical junction extending to the 
right distal ureter. Hydronephrosis of the left native kidney without any 
demonstrable cause of obstruction was also noted. On trans-urethral resection, 
the pathological finding was high-grade, non-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma.
RESULTS: The operation was successfully performed without intra- or 
post-operative complications. The patient could ambulate independently on 
post-operative day 2. The kidney graft function did not change from her 
pre-operative baseline. At 6 months' follow-up, the patient had no tumor 
recurrence, returned to normal activities, and was able to void spontaneously 
without any need of intermittent catheterization.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic bilateral nephron-ureterectomy for complete urinary 
tract extirpation is feasible, safe, and associated with low morbidity. This 
technique avoids a large abdominal midline incision or a bilateral flank 
incision for nephron-ureterectomy and is a good alternative surgical technique 
in post-kidney transplant patients who require complete urinary tract 
extirpation.

VIP neobladder (Padovana) reconstruction following radical cystectomy for 
bladder cancer Complications, functional outcome and quality of life evaluation 
in 95 cases.

Kostakopoulos N, Protogerou V, Skolarikos A, Varkarakis I, Papatsoris A, Troupis 
T, Piagou M, Deliveliotis C.

The Authors report a complete study concerning complications, the imaging and 
functional results, the clinical outcome and the quality of life in patients 
treated with VIP. 95 patients with localized bladder TCC (T2N0M0) were 
evaluated. Follow up points were 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 36th month 
with clinical and ultrasound evaluation. At 6th, 12th and 36th month CT 
pyelography and urodynamic evaluation were performed and we used a questionnaire 
for subjective bladder function and the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire to evaluate 
quality of life. Perioperative complications were ileus (2 patients; 2.1%) 
(Clavien Grade IIIb), one postoperative death (1.0%) (Clavien Grade V) and a 
resuscitated cardiac arrest (1.0%) (Clavien Grade IVa). Postoperative 
complications were incisional hernias (n=4 patients; 4.21%) (Clavien Grade I) 
and hydronephrosis in five patients (5.26%) due to ureteric/neobladder stricture 
(Clavien Grade IIIb). Urine retention due to neobladder neck stenosis was 
observed in one patient (1.0%) (Clavien Grade IIIb) and an ileo-neobladder 
fistula in one (1.0%) patient (Clavien Grade IIIb). During follow up there were 
two cancer related deaths (2.1%). According to urodynamic evaluations neobladder 
capacity increased, end-filling pressure and Qmax decreased while residual urine 
and the number of intrinsic contractions remained stable. Continence rates and 
quality of life were high and stable during follow up. VIP technique for bladder 
substitution is a relatively easy technique with low rate of complications, good 
functional results which respect the patient's quality of life.

Publisher: Viene presentato uno studio completo riguardante complicazioni,

state: laparocele in 4 pazienti (4.21% - Gradi I di Clavien) e idronefrosi in 5 
pazienti (5.26% - Grado IIIb di Clavien) in rapport a stenosi 
uretero-neovescica. In un paziente si è verificata ritenzione urinaria per 
stenosi cervicale della neovescica (1.0% - Grado IIIb di Clavien) ed in un 
paziente una fistola tra ileo e neovescica (1.0% - Grado IIIb di Clavien). 
Durante il follow up vi sono stati due decessi tardivi per causa oncologica 
(2.1%). Dal punto di vista urodinamico si è assistito all’accrescimento della 
capacità della neovescica, della pressione a fine riempimento e decrement del 
Qmax mentre il residuo urinario ed il numero delle contrazioni intrinseche sono 
rimasti stabili. Continenza e qualità di vita sono state elevate e stabili 
durante l’intero follow up. La tecnica della VIP per sostituzione vescicale è 
relativamente semplice con basso tasso di complicazioni, buoni risultati 
funzionali con rispetto della qualità di vita dei pazienti.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in developed countries is continuously increasing. 
Hence elderly patients are becoming more common in our clinical practice. 
Currently, one of the greatest challenges of medicine is balancing the life 
expectancy of elderly patients against aggressive treatments that carry 
significant risks.
OBJECTIVE: To outline the complications and survival in surgical patients 
80 years and over undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A review of a radical cystectomy in elderly recorded in 
four different institutional prospective databases during the period between 
1991 and 2014. Clinical and pathologic features, complications and survival were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were available. Median (range) age 82.2 
(80-89) years. Seventeen women and 94 men. Regarding the ASA score, 6 patients 
were ASA I, 47 patients were ASA II, 49 patients ASA III and 9 ASA IV. Prior to 
surgery, 48 patients had hydronephrosis. The median (range) creatinine series 
was 1.1 (0.71-11.1) ng/dL. In 88 cases an ileal conduit was performed, 17 a 
cutaneous ureterostomy diversion, 5 neobladders and 1 ureterosigmoidostomy case. 
The median (range) operative time was 230 (120-420) min and a total of 97 
patients required blood transfusion. The median (range) hospital stay was 14 
(7-126) days. The early and late complication rates were 50.4% and 32%, 
respectively. A total of 14 patients (12.6%) required surgical reintervention. 
Eight patients (7.2%) died in the immediate postoperative period. The 
readmission rate of the series was 27.2%. The mean follow-up of the series was 
18 (0.27-134.73) months. During this period 66 patients died, 52 of them due to 
the tumor. Twelve month tumour progression free survival was 83.9% for ≤pT1, 
70.2% for pT2 and 36% for ≥pT3, respectively. Twelve month cancer specific 
survival was 85.6% for ≤pT1, 75.1% for pT2 and 42.5% for ≥pT3, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Radical cystectomy in elderly population is an aggressive surgical 
treatment with a significant complication rate, hospital readmission and 
perioperative mortality rate. Careful selection of patients is essential in 
order to minimize the complications of this surgery and balance benefits against 
risks in the elderly population. Tumour progression and cancer specific survival 
are poor for patients with ≥pT3 disease. Alternatives such as tri-modality 
therapy need to be considered within a multi-disciplinary approach. More data is 
required to determine which sub-groups of elderly patients would benefit from a 
complication, survival and quality of life perspective.

PURPOSE: We evaluate the risk of a second urinary diversion in patients after 
radical cystectomy and urinary diversion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 1,614 patients 
who underwent urinary diversion from January 1986 to March 2009. The primary 
diversion was neobladder in 71.9% of male patients and 42.3% of female patients, 
conduit in 17.6% and 38.6%, and ureterocutaneostomy in 9.5% and 12.5%, 
respectively. The outcome of interest was the need for a second urinary 
diversion.
RESULTS: A total of 51 second/third diversions in 48 patients formed the study 
population. Mean time from primary to second diversion was 57 months (range 0 to 
286). The indication for cystectomy was oncologic in 28 patients and 
nononcologic in 23. Conversions were continent to continent (14), incontinent to 
continent (14), continent to incontinent (13) and incontinent to incontinent 
(10). Twelve patients had tumor recurrence impacting the initial diversion. In 8 
patients the indication was abscess necrosis of the diversion or radiogenic 
damage. Six patients with renal failure required conversion. All patients with 
conversion from incontinent to continent had a strong desire to avoid a stoma. 
Four patients died perioperatively and short bowel syndrome developed in 1 
patient.
CONCLUSIONS: A second urinary diversion was required in 1.8% of patients with 
bladder cancer with a heterogenous etiology vs 25% when the underlying disease 
was nononcologic. Only men with apex sparing cystectomy and women whose bladder 
had not been removed achieved excellent functional outcomes for later orthotopic 
reconstruction.

OBJECTIVE: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) parameters in 
patients who received radical cystectomy (RC) with ileal orthotopic neobladder 
(IONB) reconstruction and to identify clinic-pathologic predictors of HRQoL.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2013, a multicenter, 
retrospective on 174 RC-IONB patients was carried out. All patients completed 
the following questionnaires: the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) generic (QLQ-C30) and bladder cancer-specific 
instruments (QLQ-BLM30) and the IONB-Patient Reported Outcome (IONB-PRO). 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were computed to identify clinic-pathologic 
predictors of HRQoL.
RESULTS: Median age was 66 years (range, 31-83), and 91.4% of patients were men. 
Median follow-up period was 37 months (range, 3-247). The EORTC QLQ-C30 revealed 
that age >65 years, absence of urinary incontinence, and absence of peripheral 
vascular disease were independent predictors of deteriorated body image. A 
follow-up > 36 months and the presence of urinary incontinence were independent 
predictors of worsened urinary symptoms, whereas the absence of urinary 
incontinence was an independent predictor of a worsened body image according to 
EORTC QLQ-BLM30 results. A follow-up >36 months and the absence of urinary 
incontinence were independent predictors of better functioning in terms of 
relational life, emotional life, and fatigue as revealed by the IONB-PRO.
CONCLUSION: Age, presence of urinary incontinence, length of follow-up, and 
comorbidity status may influence postoperative HRQoL and should all be taken 
into account when counseling RC-IONB patients.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors that would aid in the identification of 
patients at the greatest risk of developing postoperative paralytic ileus.
METHODS: In the retrospective study, 749 patients who received radical 
cystectomy from January 2005 to August 2014 were reviewed, of whom, 9 who 
received orthotopic ileal neobladder were excluded. Of the 740 patients, 82 
(11.1%) developed postoperative paralytic ileus. The correlation between the 
clinical characters and the occurrence of post-operative paralytic ileus was 
identified.
RESULTS: The postoperative paralytic ileus was significantly correlated with the 
patient's age (68 vs. 67, P=0.025), body mass index (23.0 kg/m2 vs.24.1 kg/m2, 
P=0.008), different urinary diversion reconstruction methods [13.2% (66/500) for 
ileal conduit and 7.3%(16/240) for cutaneous ureterostomy, P=0.008] and pelvic 
lymph node dissection [12.2% (77/632) vs.4.6% (5/108), P=0.021].The 
postoperative paralytic ileus caused a prolonged hospital stay and delayed 
recovery (24 d vs. 17 d, P=0.000). There was no significant correlation between 
the postoperative paralytic ileus and the patients' gender, previous abdominal 
operations, preoperative hemoglobin and creatinine, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score, operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion 
requirement, laparoscopic and open surgery, ICU admission or tumor staging. On 
multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio 1.185, 95% confidence interval 
1.036-1.355, P=0.013), body mass index (hazard ratio 0.605, 95% confidence 
interval 0.427-0.857, P=0.005), different urinary diversion reconstruction 
methods (hazard ratio 2.422, 95% confidence interval 1.323-4.435, P=0.004) and 
pelvic lymph node dissection (hazard ratio 2.798, 95% confidence interval 
1.069-7.322, P=0.036) were significantly correlated with the presence of the 
postoperative paralytic ileus.
CONCLUSION: Increasing age, decreasing BMI, ileal conduiturinary diversion and 
pelvic lymph node dissection were significantly correlated with the presence of 
postoperative paralytic ileus in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.

INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine the patient and provider-related factors 
associated with readmission after radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer. In 
this era of healthcare reform, hospital performance measures, such as 
readmission, are beginning to affect provider reimbursement. Given its high 
readmission rate, RC could be a target for quality improvement.
METHODS: We reviewed bladder cancer patients who underwent RC in California's 
State Inpatient Database (2005-2009) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project. We examined patient-(e.g., race, discharge disposition) and 
provider-related factors (e.g., volume) and evaluated their association with 
30-day readmission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine 
associations of interest.
RESULTS: Overall, 22.8% (n = 833) of the 3649 patients who underwent RC were 
readmitted within 30 days. Regarding disposition, 34.8%, 50.8%, and 12.2% were 
discharged home, home with home healthcare, and to a post-acute care facility 
(PACF), respectively. Within 30 days, 20.3%, 20.9%, and 42.3% were discharged 
home, home with home healthcare, and to a PACF were readmitted, respectively. 
African Americans (odds ratio [OR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.07-2.50), having ≥2 comorbidities (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06-1.91), receiving a 
neobladder (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09-1.93), and discharged to a PACF (OR 3.79, 95% 
CI 2.88-4.98) were independent factors associated with readmission. Hospital 
stays ≥15 days were associated with less readmission (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.67, 
p = 0.0002). Procedure volume was not associated with complication, in-hospital 
mortality, or readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: About one-fifth of patients undergoing RC are readmitted. Patients 
who are discharged to a PACF, African American, and who have more extensive 
comorbidities tend to experience more readmissions. Increased efforts with care 
coordination among these patients may help reduce readmissions.

To investigate the current status and feasibility of robotic neobladder 
diversion after robotic assisted radical cystectomy. A Medline search was 
conducted resulting in identification of 423 articles. After exclusion of 
ineligible studies, 3 case series and 5 case reports were considered with a 
total number of reported cases of 203. Although robotic intracorporeal 
neobladder reconstruction is in its starting phase, initial perioperative 
results seem to be comparable to open series. However, randomized studies are 
needed to confirm non-inferiority.

PURPOSE: Decision making regarding the urethra before and after radical 
cystectomy due to urothelial carcinoma has always been controversial. To 
determine whether anterior urethra sparing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer 
is an oncologically-safe procedure, we evaluated the long-term oncologic 
clinical outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 51 male patients with cTa-4N0-2M0 bladder 
cancer were treated with anterior urethra sparing cystoprostatectomy and 
simultaneous urinary diversion between 2000 and 2013, and underwent follow up 
for 4 months or more. We assessed differences in the perioperative outcomes, 
oncologic outcomes and recurrence rates according to the urinary diversion.
RESULTS: The median patient age and follow-up period were 66 years and 
35 months, respectively. The 5- and 10-year recurrence free survival (RFS) rates 
in ileal conduit (IC) group vs. orthotopic neobladder reconstruction (NB) group 
were 45.0 and 20.3% vs. 39.3 and 19.6%, respectively. Likewise, the 5- and 
10-year disease specific survival (DSS) were 52.7 and 32.1% vs. 39.3 and 29.5%, 
respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed two independent prognostic factors 
for RFS and DSS, including age at surgery and lymph node status. Local 
recurrence in the remnant anterior urethra occurred in only 1 patient (2.0%) at 
57 months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term data show that anterior urethra sparing 
cystoprostatectomy is an oncologically-safe procedure regardless of the type of 
urinary diversion in a subset of carefully selected patients with bladder cancer 
without evidence of urothelial carcinoma in the urethra/bladder neck and 
urethral surgical margin.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with an improved technique of laparoscopic 
radical cystectomy (LRC) and orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction, 
evaluating the perioperative and pathological outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 56 cases who underwent radical 
cystoprostatectomy followed by construction of an orthotopic U-shaped ileal 
neobladder between August 2010 and December 2014. These data include 
intraoperative data, early and long-term postoperative complications, neobladder 
function, urinary continence and oncologic results. Also the key innovative 
procedure was introduced with details.
RESULTS: The median time of the overall procedure was 212 min. The median 
estimated blood loss was 171 ml. The median hospitalization time after the 
operation was 21 days. Complications included two cases of unilateral 
ureter-pouch anastomotic strictures, one case of bilateral ureteral stricture, 
three cases of vesicourethral anastomotic strictures and three cases of 
vesicourethral leakage. The mean maximum pouch capacity was 446 ± 32 ml, and 
pouch pressure at capacity was 18.1 ± 2.6 cm H2O. The Qmax was 14 ± 1.2 ml/s, 
and the mean postvoid residual was 25 ± 10 ml. There were 9 cases of night-time 
incontinence at 3 months post-operatively. Negative surgical margins of the 
bladder specimens were achieved in all patients. During a follow-up period of 
3-44 months (average 32.6 months), local recurrence was found in two patients 
and distant metastasis was occurred in another 3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary experience showed that pure LRC with nonabsorbable 
titanium staples assisted orthotopic U-shape ileal neobladder reconstruction is 
feasible based on perioperative data and oncologic features.

BACKGROUND: Continent cutaneous diversions play a secondary role even in many 
centers for urinary diversion. The result is that knowledge about, indications 
and operation technique does not exist in many clinics.
RESULTS: The general complication rates of the various forms of urinary 
diversion are not significantly different. There is no quality of life study 
showing a significant advantage for either form of urinary diversion. The 
functional results of neobladders in females with up to 70% hypercontinence are 
worse than in men, resulting in 2.4-fold more continent urinary diversions in 
men compared to women. The complication rates of the various forms of continent 
cutaneous pouches are different.
CONCLUSION: Continent cutaneous pouches are an option for all patients with 
non-existing or functionally unusable urethra and as primary indication in all 
women with bladder cancer, consulting in very good quality of life and perfect 
body image. Age (<75 years), manual skills and psychological ability are 
selection criteria. As far as the results and complication rates are concerned 
the ileocecal pouch with an appendix umbilical stoma is the best option. In 
cases of non-existing appendix, alternatives are a neoappendix, serosal lined 
tapered ileum and ileal invagination nipple.

INTRODUCTION: Transfusion with red blood cells (RBCs) is associated with adverse 
clinical outcomes. We determined whether an intraoperative RBC transfusion is 
related to postoperative complications in patients undergoing open radical 
cystectomy. We also compared the effect of transfusion with fresh versus old 
blood on postoperative complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 261 patients undergoing open radical cystectomy 
were divided into no-transfusion or transfusion groups. Transfused patients were 
divided according to RBC storage duration (fresh, ≤ 14 days; old, > 14 days). 
Postoperative complications, such as infection, paralytic ileus, urinary tract 
obstruction, and anastomotic leak, were noted.
RESULTS: Infection (26.5%) was the most common postoperative complication, 
followed by procedural (17.6%), gastrointestinal (16.7%), renal (13.7%), and 
vascular (10.5%) problems. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.00-1.07; P = .029), urinary diversion with a neobladder (OR, 2.30; 95% 
CI, 1.29-4.11; P = .005), and intraoperative RBC transfusion (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 
1.02-3.07; P = .042) were independent predictors of postoperative complications 
in a binary logistic analysis. Patients (n = 172; old blood, n = 47; fresh 
blood, n = 116; mixed blood, n = 9) who received an intraoperative RBC 
transfusion had a higher incidence of postoperative complications than those (n 
= 89) who did not undergo intraoperative transfusion (65.1% vs. 49.4%, P < .05). 
No difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between 
transfusions with old blood and fresh blood was observed (63.8% vs. 65.5%).
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative RBC transfusion is associated with increased 
postoperative complications in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy. The 
RBC storage duration may not affect the incidence of postoperative complications 
in this study population.

BACKGROUND: Intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder (iONB) creation following 
robotic radical cystectomy is an emerging procedure and robust functional data 
are required.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate urodynamic features of iONB and bladder cancer-specific 
and general health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively assessed 28 men who 
underwent iONB creation (January 2012 to October 2013) and compared results to a 
previously characterized cohort of 79 of open ONB procedures.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: iONB pressure-volume properties 
were characterized using multichannel urodynamics (UDS). The Bladder Cancer 
Index (BCI) questionnaire, modified with mucus- and pad-related questions, and 
the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were used to evaluate urinary function and 
HRQOL. ONB cohorts were compared for functional outcomes and BCI score. 
Multivariable linear regression was used to assess predictors of BCI score.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median follow-up was 9.4 mo for the iONB and 62.1 
mo for the open ONB group (p<0.0001); ≥2-yr follow-up had been completed for one 
(4%) patient in the iONB group compared to 75 (95%) patients in the open ONB 
group (p<0.0001). In UDS tests, the iONB group had minimal postvoid residual 
volume, normal compliance, and a mean capacity of 514 cm(3) (range 339-1001). 
BCI mean scores for urinary function (p=0.58) and urinary bother (p=0.31) were 
comparable between the groups. The surgical approach was not associated with the 
BCI score on multivariable analysis. Rates of 24-h pad use were comparable 
between iONB and open ONB groups (pad-free 17% vs. 19%; ≤2 pads 84% vs. 79%), as 
reflected by total pad usage (p=0.1); pad size and daytime wetness were worse in 
the iONB group. The clean intermittent catheterization rate was 10.7% in the 
iONB and 6.3% in the open ONB group. Limitations include the retrospective 
comparison, small number of patients and short follow-up for the iONB group.
CONCLUSIONS: iONB had adequate UDS characteristics and comparable bladder 
cancer-specific HRQOL scores to open ONB. However, pad size and daytime wetness 
were worse for iONB, albeit over significantly shorter follow-up.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We demonstrate that the volumetric and pressure characteristics 
are acceptable for a neobladder created using an entirely robot-assisted 
laparoscopic technique after bladder removal for cancer. Urinary function and 
quality-of-life outcomes related to the robotic technique were compared to those 
for neobladders created via an open surgical technique. We found that urinary 
function and bother indices were comparable; however, the robotic group required 
larger incontinence pads that were wetter during the daytime. This may be 
explained by the significantly shorter duration of recovery after surgery in the 
robotic group.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Two-port laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) using 
a multichannel platform through the umbilicus and one additional 10-mm in the 
right iliac fossa has been recently described. We compare the perioperative and 
early results of this technique with a cohort of patients simultaneously treated 
in our institution with four-port LRC and a 7 to 10 cm midline incision.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A matched-pair study comparing perioperative outcomes, 
postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAPS), and morbidity of two-port (n=30) 
and four-port (n=30) LRC. Preoperative and perioperative data analyzed and 
compared included demographics, type of urinary diversion, operative time, blood 
loss, transfusion requirements, decrease in serum hemoglobin, operative 
complications, analgesic needs, length of stay, number of nodes removed, and 
other pathologic information. Complications in the first 3 months were evaluated 
according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding 
patient age, gender, body-mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists 
(ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index, tumor stage, percent of positive nodes, 
positive margin rate, number of nodes retrieved, proportion of neobladders, 
secondary carcinoma in situ, incidental prostate cancer, or need of systemic 
chemotherapy. Median operative time was 20 minutes higher in the two-port 
procedure, but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2). 
Estimated blood loss and differential hemoglobin change were lower in the 
two-port technique (each p=0.03), but no difference was detected regarding the 
intraoperative or postoperative transfusion rate. Length of hospital stay was 
also equivalent. Differences were not observed either in the number or severity 
of complications. VAPS at days 2, 3, and 5 was significantly lower for two-port 
LRC (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Two-port LRC performed through an umbilical platform and an 
accessory 10-mm port seems technically equivalent to standard four-port LRC. 
Perioperative outcomes regarding hospital stay and complications are tantamount. 
Diminished blood loss and, especially, less postoperative pain favor the 
reduced-port approach in this complex urologic minimally invasive procedure.

Enterovesical fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the 
intestine. The accurate localization of leakage is important for accurate 
treatment planning. Some imaging techniques can not demonstrate the fistula; 
therefore, choosing the appropriate imaging technique is necessary. CT 
enterography (CTE) is a new technique for evaluation of the small bowel and the 
entire abdomen. CTE examination with multi-detector CT (MDCT) enables us to get 
excellent quality reformatted images with high spatial resolution. We report a 
patient with neobladder and enteroneovesical fistula. We showed the exact 
location of the fistula and its' association with the bowels and neobladder by 
CTE. The aim of this report is to show that CTE can be a new and effective 
modality in the detection of enteroneovesical fistulas and to discuss the 
efficacy of CTE in the detection and evaluation of enterovesical fistula 
referring to the literature. In conclusion, CTE may be a useful, sensitive, 
effective, and non-invasive technique for the evaluation of enteroneovesical 
fistula, leakage from the anastomose sides, and other extraintestinal 
complications such as urinary tract obstruction or abscess formation.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a robot-assisted intracorporeal pyramid neobladder 
reconstruction technique and report operative and perioperative metrics, 
postoperative upper tract imaging, neobladder functional outcomes, and 
oncological outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 20 patients (19 male and one female) with a mean 
(sd; range) age of 57.2 (12.4; 31.0-78.2) years underwent robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy (RARC). Most cases were ≤pT1 (17 patients) and the remaining three 
patients had muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) at RARC histopathology. 
Although half of the patients (10) actually had MIBC at transurethral resection 
histopathology. All patients underwent RARC, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, 
and intracorporeal neobladder formation using a pyramid detubularised folding 
pouch configuration.
RESULTS: The median estimated blood loss was 250 mL and operating time was 
5.5 h. The mean (sd) number of lymph nodes removed was 16.5 (7.8) and median 
hospital stay was 10 days. Early postoperative complications included urinary 
tract infection (UTI) (four patients), ileus (four), diarrhoea and vomiting 
(three), postoperative collection (two), and blocked stent (one). Late 
postoperative complications included UTI (seven patients), neobladder stone 
(two), voiding Hem-o-Loc (two), neobladder leak (two), diarrhoea and vomiting 
(one), uretero-ileal stricture (one), vitamin B12 deficiency (one), and 
port-site hernia (one). There was no evidence of hydronephrosis in 18 patients 
with a median follow-up of 21.5 months. At 24 months, recurrence-free survival 
was 86% and overall survival was 100%. In all, 19 patients and 13 patients 
reported 6-month day time and night time continence, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The pyramid neobladder is technically feasible using a robotic 
platform and provides satisfactory functional outcomes at median of 21.5 months.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility, operative morbidity and oncological 
outcome of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) radical cystectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with clinical stage T1-T2 bladder cancer 
underwent a LESS radical cystectomy. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 64.8 
(8.6) years and their mean body mass index was 25.9 (2.7) kg/m(2). The procedure 
was done via a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port using a rigid 5-mm 30° 
long-shaft laparoscope in addition to the two working instruments. A 7-cm 
Pfannenstiel incision was made to remove the specimens and to allow the creation 
of an ileal neobladder with hand assistance.
RESULTS: In eight patients the LESS radical cystectomy was completed as 
scheduled, with the other two requiring a conversion, one to an open procedure 
due to locally advanced disease, and the other to conventional laparoscopy due 
to gas leakage. The mean (SD) operative duration was 236 (49) min, with a mean 
estimated blood loss of 575 (113) mL, and a mean hospital stay of 5.5 
(0.7) days. No postoperative analgesic medications were prescribed and patients 
returned to normal activity after a mean (SD) of 17.6 (2.6) days. The 
pathological examination showed negative surgical margins for the bladder 
specimens, with a mean (SD) of 14 (1.9) lymph nodes retrieved. Seven patients 
were cancer-free within a mean (SD, range) follow-up of 37 (6, 29-44) months.
CONCLUSIONS: LESS radical cystectomy is technically feasible, with a favourable 
course and convalescence, and it has an acceptable oncological outcome.

Italy.

INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted between January 2001 and December 2013 to 
evaluate patient's outcomes after radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal 
neobladder from a morphological and functional point of view at a median 
follow-up of 2 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 48 eligible patents were included. We first 
report our technical modifications to Studer's neobladder. Sequently, after a 
medium follow-up of two years, we assessed morphology of the reservoir and 
voiding functionality of this patients cohort, submitting them to specific 
questionnaires and to uroflowmetry.
RESULTS: Early and late postoperative data are available for 36 patients. From 
the morphological follow-up, 2 years after surgery, six patients had 
hydroureteronephrosis for vescico-ureteral reflux in four cases (11% of total) 
and uretero-neobladder anastomosis stenosis in the other two (5.6% of total). 
Neobladder shape always remained spherical, with a relative right lateralization 
in eight cases (22.2%). Regarding the nine patients subjected to uroflowmetry, 
seven (77.7%) highlighted the lack of postvoid residual urine, with a maximum 
urinary flow rate within the normal range in six of them.
DISCUSSION: Improvements in surgical technique may help to reduce complications 
rate. From uroflowmetry analysis, we can observe that the mean filling pressure 
following surgery was relatively stable and urinary flow rate was mostly 
satisfactory. In patients without postvoid residual urine, all referred absence 
of daily incontinence and good quality of life.
CONCLUSION: From this morpho-functional evaluation, our orthotopic 
Studer-modified ileal neobladder seems an ideal solution for urinary diversion, 
presenting functional features similar to native bladder and assuming a 
well-defined morphology, not changing in time.

Functional and Clinicopathologic Outcomes Using a Modified Vescica Ileale 
Padovana Technique.

IN, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinicopathologic and functional outcomes of a 
modified Vescica ileale Padovana (VIP) neobladder technique.
METHODS: Data for 160 patients at a single institution who underwent radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic VIP neobladder creation between 1998 and 2013 were 
analyzed. Modified VIP technique involved longitudinal opening of the small 
bowel close to the anterior mesenteric border instead of along the true 
anti-mesentery. This allowed for creation of a dependent neourethral funnel and 
a large serosal surface for ureteral anastomosis, distant from any suture lines.
RESULTS: Mean age for the entire cohort was 59.5, with 9% female and 64% with 
muscle invasive disease prior to cystectomy. Within 30 days of surgery, 16 
patients (10%) developed a Clavien grade 3-4 complication and there were no 
deaths. Ninety-six percent reported minor or no daytime urinary leakage at 12 
months, and 70% reported minor or no nighttime urinary leakage. Two- and 
five-year overall survival rates were 84.2% and 72.6% , respectively. Seven 
patients developed a ureteral stricture (4%), three (2%) had bladder neck 
contractures, two (1%) experienced urethral recurrence, and there were no 
vesicovaginal fistulas.
CONCLUSIONS: This modified VIP neobladder technique achieves favorable 
functional, survival, and recurrence outcomes similar to other published 
orthotopic continent diversions. Its near spheroidal shape lowers internal 
pressure, allowing for improved continence at physiologic filling capacity, and 
its offset bowel opening helps prevent unnecessary stretch to the native 
urethra, even in large individuals. The widened uretero-enteric anastomosis site 
distant from bowel suture lines contributes to decreased stricture rates and its 
placement on the dome of the neobladder facilitates endoscopic access should 
strictures occur. Finally, lack of posterior overlapping suture lines also 
mitigates the risk of fistulae formation in females should anterior vaginal wall 
excision or entry be unavoidable.

BACKGROUND: A second primary tumors of the urethra (urethral recurrence) after 
radical cystectomy has been reported to be more infrequent in patients with 
ileal orthotopic (neobladder) compared to incontinent diversions.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an altered immunogenic environment of urethral 
tissue is induced by urethro-ileal anastomosis.
METHODS: Between 10/2008 and 12/2009 urethral biopsies of 19 patients (9 
neobladder patients, 10 control patients without urethra-ileal anastomosis) were 
evaluated by conventional histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry 
for T- (CD3/CD5, CD4, CD8) and B-cell markers (CD20/22, CD79a, CD138). After 
semi-quantitative assessment, relative cell fractions (B vs. T cells) and 
subclasses (T4-helper vs. T8-killer cells vs. B cell clones, plasma cells) in 
neobladder vs. control patients were studied. Unpaired t-test was used for 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Of 19 included patients, 16 were eligible for analysis (7x neobladder, 
9x controls). All neobladder patients had undergone cystectomy for UBC. 
Comparing relative fractions of cells positive for T- and B-cell markers in NB 
and CO patients, no statistical differences were observed. In 4/7 neobladder 
patients relative fraction of CD79a positive B-cells was higher than relative 
fraction of CD3/CD5 positive T-cells (B/T-ratio 1.3). B cells were predominantly 
CD138 positive plasma cells (5/7 NB patients). Relative B-cell fraction was 
lower than T-cell fraction in 7/9 control patients (B/T-ratio 0.6). Neither CD 
138 positive plasma cells nor CD22 positive B cell clones were predominant. 
T-helper and CD8 positive T-killer cells were equally distributed in both 
neobladder (CD4/CD8-ratio: 2.1) and control patients (CD4/CD8-ratio: 1.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Comparing neobadder and control patients the distribution of B- and 
T-cells was statistically not different. However, a trend towards an increased 
presence of B-cells in urethral tissues of NB patients that could become 
relevant in a larger study might be suggestive for an immunological response 
induced by connecting urethral and ileal tissue.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate perioperative, oncological 
and functional outcomes of the "I-Pouch" neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2002 to 2011, 97 patients (72 men, 25 women, median 
age 65, range 42-84 years) underwent radical cystectomy with I-Pouch neobladder 
reconstruction. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo 
classification. Oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. The median 
oncological and functional follow-up was 41 months (range 3-107 months) and 18 
months (3-111 months), respectively.
RESULTS: In the total cohort, the 5 year cancer-specific survival was 67.9%. The 
major 30 and 90 day complication rates were 14.4% and 17.5%, respectively. Open 
reimplantation for ureterointestinal stricture was necessary in two (2.1%). Of 
the 95 functionally evaluable patients postoperatively, 93 urinated 
spontaneously (97.9%) and two patients (2.1%) required clean intermittent 
catheterization to empty their neobladder. The median postvoid residual urine 
volume (PVR) was 0 ml (range 0-200 ml). One patient had postoperative reflux 
(1%), as evidenced by voiding cystography. The median number of urinary tract 
infections per year was 0 (range 0-2) and showed no association with increased 
PVR (p = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: The perioperative, oncological and functional outcomes of the 
I-Pouch are comparable to those of other types of ileal neobladder. An advantage 
of the I-Pouch is that the implantation of the ureters lies on the neobladder 
floor, which facilitates later instrumentation of the upper tract.

INTRODUCTION: Total intra-corporeal robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) 
with total intracorporeal neobladder formation is relatively new in the 
treatment of bladder cancer. We present our experience and believe it is the 
first Canadian reported series with this technique.
METHODS: This is a case series of 4 patients, who underwent total RARC, pelvic 
lymphadenectomy and creation of an intra-corporeal ileal neobladder. Surgical 
technique is described and perioperative variables, pathologic data, and 
complication rates are reported.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 61.8 and the mean body mass index was 27.01 
kg/m(2). The mean operative time, estimated blood loss, time to full diet and 
length of stay were 522.8 minutes (standard deviation [SD] 74.5), 237.5 mL (SD 
47.9), 9 days (range: 3-24) and 12.8 days (range: 6-31), respectively. All 
patients completed postoperative functional evaluation showing a mean neobladder 
capacity of 575 cc (range: 500-720). Surgical margins and pathological nodal 
status were negative in all patients with no evidence of disease recurrence or 
progression on follow-up. Three of the 4 patients suffered a complication within 
90 days, with one occurring later in the first year. All early complications 
were Clavien grade I-II (grade I [n = 1]; grade II [n = 2]) and the later 
complication was grade IIIa. The mean follow-up was 632 days (range: 562-730). 
The limitation of our study is its small sample size with highly selected 
patients to compensate for the learning experience. The follow-up is short; 
however, the outcomes are comparable to early experiences reported at other 
institutions.
CONCLUSIONS: In our initial experience, RARC with total intracorporeal 
neobladder formation is safe. We expect that with experience the expense of 
robotic surgery can be compensated with early ambulation and shorter stay.

Radical cystectomy in eldery.

Bancević V, Aleksić P, Milović N, Spasić A, Kovacević B, Tosevski P, Campara Z, 
Milosević R, Cerović S.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Radical cystectomy is the method of choice for the treatment of 
muscle invasive bladder cancer. This major surgery is associated with many 
complications, especially in older patients. The aim of this study was to 
analyze preoperative comorbidity, and intraoperative and postoperative 
complicatons in patients older than 75 years.
METHODS: This clinical, retrospective study included 46 patients over 75 years, 
who underwent radical cystectomy. Indications for surgery, and complications 
during and after the surgery were followed up.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, anemia caused by hematuria was registered in 76% of the 
patients. In 52% of the patients urine derivation was performed by ileal 
conduit, in 35% by ureterocutaneostomy and in 13% orthotopic ileal neobladder 
was created. The average duration of surgery was 190 (120-300) min. A total of 
76% of the patients were treated by blood supstitution intraoperatively, average 
630 (310-1230) mL. Concerning pathological stage of transitional cell carcinoma 
of urinary bladder, 26% of the patients had T2, 4% T3a, 52% T3b, and 14% T4a 
stage. In one case, planocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by patohistological 
examination, and in 2 cases prostate carcinoma was incidentally found. The 
average duration of hospitalization was 16 (8-35) days.
CONCLUSION: The main reason for cystectomy in patients over 70-and 80 years was 
gross hematuria caused by bladder cancer, with consecutive anemia which could 
not be solved using endoscopic treat- ment or blood supstitution. As expected, a 
prolonged stay in hospital after cystectomy, and a higher rate of complications 
were recorded in this population.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate current status of diagnosis and treatment of bladder 
cancer in China.
METHODS: A database was generated by Chinese Bladder Cancer Consortium (CBCC). 
From January 2007 to December 2012, 14,260 cases from 44 CBCC centers were 
included. Data of diagnosis, treatment and pathology were collected.
RESULTS: The average age was 63.5 year-old and most patients were male (84.3%). 
The most common histologic types were urothelial carcinoma (91.4%), 
adenocarcinoma (1.8%), and squamous carcinoma (1.9%). According to 1973 and 2004 
WHO grading system, 42.0%, 41.0%, and 17.0% of patients were grade 1, 2, and 3, 
and 16.0%, 48.7%, and 35.3% of patients were papillary urothelial neoplasms of 
low malignant potential, low, and high grade, respectively. Non-muscle invasive 
bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) were 25.2% and 
74.1%, respectively (0.8% not clear). Carcinoma in situ was only 2.4%. Most 
patients were diagnosed by white-light cystoscopy with biopsy (74.3%). 
Fluorescence and narrow band imaging cystoscopy had additional detection rate of 
1.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Diagnostic transurethral resection (TUR) provided 
detection rate of 16.9%. Most NMIBCs were treated with TUR (89.2%). After 
initial TUR, 2.6% accepted second TUR, and 45.7%, 69.9%, and 58.7% accepted 
immediate, induced, and maintenance chemotherapy instillation, respectively. 
Most MIBCs were treated with radical cystectomy (RC, 59.7%). Laparoscopic RCs 
were 35.1%, while open RC 63.4%. Extended and standard pelvic lymph node 
dissection were 7% and 66%, respectively. Three most common urinary diversions 
were orthotopic neobladder (44%), ileal conduit (31%), and ureterocutaneostomy 
(23%). Only 2.3% of patients accepted neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and only 18% of 
T3 and T4 patients accepted adjuvant chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Disease characteristics are similar to international reports, while 
differences of diagnosis and treatment exist. This study can provide evidences 
for revisions of the guideline on bladder cancer in China.

[Differences in morbidity of neobladder versus ileal conduit: a matched pair 
analysis on 134 patients].

[Article in Italian]

Antonelli A, Belotti S, Zamboni S, Cristinelli de L, Simeone C.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether performing an 
ileal conduit (IC) versus a neobladder(NB) during radical cystectomy (RC) can 
play a role on the morbidity of the surgical procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At our institution since 2001, a database collecting the 
data of more than 450 patients who have undergone RC is perspectively 
maintained.The records of 246 patients submitted to RC and IC and 120 to RC and 
NB have been reviewed for the present study. By a binary logistic regression 
model, a propensity score was generated joining these factors: gender,age, 
smoking habit, Charlson’ comorbidity score, platelet antiaggregants or oral 
anticoagulant therapy, ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) score, 
hydronephrosis, pathologic T stage, and lymphadenectomy. A group of patients 
submitted to IC and another to NB having the closer propensity score were 
created with a matching ratio of 1:1. The following features were compared 
between the two groups: operative time, blood loss,intraoperative complication 
rate, and postoperative complications rate (overall, clavien 1-2, clavien ≥, 
related toRC, relate to urinary reconstruction).Results: One hundred thirty-four 
patients were selected, 67 submitted to NB, 67 to IC, well matched according to 
the desired features. No differences were noted for all the compared 
features.Conclusion: The morbidity of RC does not seem to be dependent on the 
choice to perform IC versus NB.

PURPOSE: The need to prevent reflux in the construction of an orthotopic ileal 
neobladder is controversial. We designed the USC-STAR trial to determine whether 
the T-pouch neobladder that included an antireflux mechanism was superior to the 
Studer pouch in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single center, randomized, controlled trial 
recruited patients with clinically nonmetastatic bladder cancer scheduled to 
undergo radical cystectomy with neobladder. Eligible patients were randomly 
assigned to undergo T-pouch or Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder. Treatment 
assignment was not masked. The primary end point was change in renal function 
from baseline to 3 years. The CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
Collaboration) equation was used to calculate the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate.
RESULTS: Between February 2002 and November 2009, 237 patients were randomly 
assigned to T-pouch ileal orthotopic neobladder and 247 to Studer ileal 
orthotopic neobladder. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the 
groups. Between baseline and 3 years the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
decreased by 6.4 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the Studer group and 6.6 ml/minute/1.73 
m(2) in the T-pouch group (p=0.35). Multivariable analysis showed that type of 
ileal orthotopic neobladder was not independently associated with 3-year renal 
function (p=0.63). However, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, age 
and urinary tract obstruction were independently associated with 3-year decline 
in renal function. Cumulative risk of urinary tract infection and overall late 
complications were not different between the groups, but the T-pouch was 
associated with an increased risk of secondary diversion related surgeries.
CONCLUSIONS: T-pouch ileal orthotopic neobladder with an antireflux mechanism 
did not prevent a moderate reduction in renal function observed at 3 years 
compared to the Studer pouch, but did result in an increase in diversion related 
secondary surgical procedures.

OBJECTIVE: To study the functional outcomes of 30 patients who had previously 
undergone laparoscopic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal orthotopic ileal 
neobladder reconstruction using videourodynamic (VUDM) assessment 180 days 
postoperatively.
METHODS: Between November 2010 and December 2013, 30 male patients had undergone 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy with bilateral standard pelvic lymphadenectomy 
and pure laparoscopic orthotopic ileal U-shaped neobladder diversion. The 
demographic data were as follows: median age, 67 years (range, 62-79); body mass 
index, 22.3 kg/m(2) (range, 16-26.1 kg/m(2)); and mean American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score 2.2 (range, 1-3). Functional outcomes were assessed 
performing a standard VUDM study combined with perineal floor electromyography 
180 days postoperatively.
RESULTS: VUDM evaluations showed good functional outcomes of the reservoirs. 
Mean maximal neobladder capacity was 287 mL (range, 210-335 mL). Residual 
peristaltic activity was observed in all the individuals evaluated; however, 
only 9 of 30 individuals (30%) displayed severe peristaltic activity. Six of 
these 9 individuals (66.6%) experienced urinary leakage during these 
contractions. Mean postvoid residual volume was 44 mL (range, 0-105 mL), and 
peak flow rate was 13.9 mL/s (range, 9.7-29.2 mL/s). The Valsalva maneuver was 
positive in 5 of 30 subjects (17%). Bladder morphology assessed during contrast 
cystography showed the desired U-shape in all cases. Ureteral reflux was 
observed in 7 of 30 individuals (23.3%).
CONCLUSION: Based on VUDM, our study shows that U-shaped ileal neobladders 
achieved by a totally laparoscopic approach obtained good functional outcomes. 
These findings support the evidence that a minimally invasive approach does not 
impose technical limitations that negatively impact the surgical results.

Introduction. Urinary diversion is very often associated with urinary retention 
and urinary incontinence. In this study, a surgical modification during 
cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder is presented. Material and Methods. 
Female patients enrolled in the study (n-24) were subjected to sacrocolpopexy 
during the operation. Apart from oncological control, the follow-up consisted of 
1-hour inlay test and questionnaires (UDI-6 and IIQ-7) in the 3rd, 6th, and 12th 
month after the operation. In the 12th month after the surgery, the urodynamic 
pressure-flow test was performed. Outcomes were compared with the control group 
(n-18) in which sacrocolpopexy was not implemented. Results. The study group was 
characterised by reduced urinary retention and improved continence. Conclusion. 
Sacrocolpopexy during cystectomy with orthotopic ileal bladder is a valuable 
surgical method which provides patients with a better quality of life.

PURPOSE: To evaluate potential socioeconomic and demographic factors that may 
influence or be associated with various types of urinary reconstruction (UR) 
following a radical cystectomy (RC) accounting for existing clinical variables.
METHODS: There were 828 patients that underwent a RC and UR between 2000 and 
2013. After excluding patients that did not meet medical or surgical criteria 
for a continent urinary reconstruction (CUR-orthotopic neobladder or continent 
catheterizable pouch), there were 714 patients available for analysis. 
Socioeconomic and demographic data along with disease-specific variables were 
recorded preoperatively and analyzed to determine a correlation with a 
particular type of UR.
RESULTS: Non-continent urinary reconstruction (ileal conduit or cutaneous 
ureterostomies) and CUR accounted for 78.3 % (559/714) and 21.7 % (155/714) of 
UR following RC, respectively. On univariate analysis, younger age, marital 
status, employment status, type of insurance, ASA score, and preoperative 
glomerular filtration rate were significantly associated with CUR (p < 0.01). 
Travel distance, race, and education level were not factors for UR type. 
Additionally, there was no significant difference between males and females 
receiving a CUR. On multivariate analysis, older age [odds ratio (OR) 0.85, p < 
0.01], marital status (OR 0.28, p < 0.01), insurance status (OR 0.22, p = 0.04), 
and higher ASA score (OR 0.50, p < 0.01) remained independent predictors of 
those less likely to receive a CUR.
CONCLUSION: Predictable socioeconomic and demographic influences exist between 
the choice of UR after RC. Increasing age corresponds to a decreasing likelihood 
of receiving a CUR. No significant difference was seen between men and women in 
undergoing a CUR.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate risk factors for urethral recurrence (UR) in women with 
neobladder.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1994 to 2011, 297 women (median age = 54 y; 
interquartile range: 47-57) underwent radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder 
for bladder cancer in 4 centers. None of the patients had bladder neck 
involvement at preoperative assessment. Univariable and multivariable analyses 
were used to estimate recurrence-free survival and overall survival. The median 
follow-up was 64 months (interquartile range: 25-116).
RESULTS: Of the 297 patients, 81 developed recurrence (27%). The 10- and 15-year 
recurrence-free survival rates were 66% and 66%, respectively. The 10- and 
15-year overall survival rates were 57% and 55%, respectively. UR occurred in 2 
patients (0.6%) with solitary urethral, 4 (1.2%) with concomitant urethral and 
distant recurrence, and 1 with concomitant urethral and local recurrence (0.3%). 
Bladder tumors were located at the trigone in 27 patients (9.1%). None of these 
patients developed UR. Lymph node tumor involvement was present in 60 patients 
(20.2%). On univariable and multivariable analyses, pathologic tumor and nodal 
stage were independent predictors for the overall risk of recurrence. UR was 
associated with a positive final urethral margin status (P<0.001) whereas no 
significant associations were found for carcinoma in situ, pathologic tumor and 
nodal stage, and bladder trigone involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series, only 0.6% of women developed solitary UR. A 
positive final urethral margin was associated with an increased risk of UR. 
Women with involvement of the bladder trigone were not at higher risk of UR.

BACKGROUND: Quality of life after anterior or total exenteration is determined, 
among other factors, by the type of urinary diversion. There are two different 
types of urinary diversion: incontinent diversion (ureterocutaneostomy, ileal 
conduit, and colonic conduit) and continent diversions (continent cutaneous 
pouch, orthotopic neobladder, and rectal reservoir).
RESULTS: Invasive bladder cancer and advanced or recurrent gynecological tumors 
are the main indications for continent urinary diversion in women. In patients 
with non-irradiated bladder cancer, an orthotopic neobladder (except those with 
tumor invasion of the bladder neck or urethra) or a rectal reservoir is an 
option. In patients who had received preoperative radiotherapy, non-irradiated 
bowel segments should be used for urinary diversion (e.g., the transverse 
colon). In patients with planned postoperative radiation, the urinary diversion 
should be outside the radiation field.
CONCLUSION: Advantages and disadvantages of all types of urinary diversion 
should be objectively discussed with the patient. Especially exenteration for 
advanced or recurrent gynecological cancers should be performed in centers with 
a multidisciplinary team (gynecologist, urologist, radiotherapist, and in cases 
with complete exenteration the gastrointestinal surgeon).

[Muscle-invasive bladder cancer].

[Article in French]

Pashootan P, Legrand G, Ploussard G.

Muscle invasive bladder cancers represent 20 to 30% of bladder tumors and are 
metastatic at diagnosis in 10% of cases. The diagnosis is based on histological 
analysis of transuretral resection pieces. An invasion of the detrusor (stage 
pT2) signs the infiltrating nature of the tumor. The local and general staging 
is based on thoraco-abdominopelvic CT. The standard treatment for localized 
stages is cystoprostatectomy in men and anterior pelvic exenteration in women. 
For urinary diversion, the two choices are cutaneous non continent ileal conduit 
(Bricker) and ileal neobladder. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be discussed for 
locally advanced stages. The concomitant chemoradiotherapy is an alternative to 
surgical treatment in elderly or frail patients. The management of metastatic 
bladder cancer is based on systemic chemotherapy.

[Management and complications of urinary diversions].

[Article in French]

Davin JL.

After cystectomy, the urine is eliminated by the uretra (orthotopic neobladder) 
or through a stoma. Orthotopic neobladder is done by priority when feasible. 
Practical aspects have to be managed very strictly by the urologist and the 
staff nurse. Side effects and complications are quite frequent (incontinence, 
retention, infection, diminished renal function, metabolic disorders, stoma 
complications) and need an adapted follow-up to propose adapted management if 
necessary.

Orthotopic neobladder reconstruction is becoming an increasingly common urinary 
diversion following cystectomy for bladder cancer. This is in recognition of the 
potential benefits of neobladder surgery over creation of an ileal conduit 
related to quality of life (QoL), such as avoiding the need to form a stoma with 
its cosmetic, psychological and other potential complications. The PubMed 
database was searched using relevant search terms for articles published 
electronically between January 1994 and April 2014. Full-text articles in 
English or with English translation were assessed for relevance to the topic 
before being included in the review. Patients with neobladders have comparable 
or better post-operative sexual function than those with ileal conduits. They 
also have comparable QoL to those with ileal conduits. Orthotopic neobladder is 
a good alternative to ileal conduit in suitable patients who do not want a stoma 
and are motivated to comply with neobladder training. However, the selection of 
a neobladder as the urinary diversion of choice requires that patients have good 
renal and liver functions and are likely to be compliant with neobladder 
training. With benefits also come potential risks of neobladder formation. These 
include electrolyte abnormalities and nocturnal incontinence. This short review 
highlights current aspects of neobladder formation and its potential advantages.

Bladder cancer is an important health problem worldwide due to high prevalence 
rates and costs related to treatment. A reduction in recurrence rates has been 
observed since the introduction of adjuvant intravesical immunotherapy with 
bacillus Calmette-Guerin. There are mild complications that are easily solved by 
local measures and orientations. Bladder contracture, a rare and severe local 
complication, in some cases leading to disability, is observed primarily in 
patients in a maintenance program. In this article we reported the case of a 
male patient who underwent transurethral resection of the bladder because of a 
high-grade T1 urothelial carcinoma and developed this complication during 
treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. For this reason he was submitted to 
cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction.

O câncer de bexiga é um importante problema de saúde mundial, tanto pelas 
elevadas taxas de prevalência, quanto pelos custos relacionados ao tratamento. 
Desde a introdução da imunoterapia intravesical adjuvante com bacilo 
Calmette-Guérin, vem sendo observada diminuição na taxa de recorrência. As 
principais complicações são de pequeno porte e simples resolução a partir de 
medidas locais e orientações. A bexiga contraída, uma complicação local rara e 
grave, mas incapacitante em alguns casos, é observada principalmente em doentes 
com um programa de manutenção. Relatamos aqui o caso de um paciente masculino 
submetido a ressecção transuretral da bexiga por um carcinoma urotelial T1 de 
alto grau, que desenvolveu tal complicação durante tratamento com bacilo 
Calmette-Guérin, sendo portanto submetido à cistoprostatectomia com realização 
de neobexiga ortotópica ileal.

OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy with intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder and to evaluate the 
role of endoscopic stapling in neobladder construction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with bladder cancer who underwent 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy were retrospectively examined. Extended pelvic 
lymph node dissection was performed before cystectomy. An ileal segment of 50 cm 
was harvested to construct a U-shaped reservoir. The bottom of the reservoir was 
anastomosed with the posterior urethra. Twenty-five patients underwent 
neobladder construction by manual suturing and 30 patients by endoscopic stapler 
suturing.
RESULTS: The mean operative time was 346 minutes, and mean neobladder 
construction time was 230 minutes. The median estimated blood loss was 500 mL, 
and 17 patients received intraoperative transfusion. Postoperative complications 
included 2 cases of urine leakage, 7 cases of pyelonephritis, 4 cases of 
incomplete bowel obstruction, 1 case of anastomotic stricture, and 1 case of 
death. Endoscopic stapler suturing for neobladder construction took 
significantly less time than manual suturing. However, neobladder stones were 
found in 2 patients who underwent operation using endoscopic suturing, and the 
stones were removed cystoscopically. The functional outcomes of the 2 
constructive methods were comparable.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal orthotopic 
neobladder is safe and feasible for experienced laparoscopic surgeons. 
Application of endoscopic stapler simplifies the surgical procedure while 
increasing the risk of neobladder stone formation.

A 67-year-old male underwent a radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder 
construction in September 2002. He developed adhesive ileus postoperatively and 
underwent an intestine-ascending colon bypass operation with a side-to-side 
anastomosis in December of 2002. Subsequently, the patient developed ileus 
frequently, which improved with conservative management. In February 2013, he 
had fecaluria and was diagnosed with an ileal neobladder-enteric fistula based 
on computed tomography 2 hours after contrast medium injection. He underwent 
closure of the intestinal anal side of the anastomosis between the intestine and 
ascending colon. The fecaluria disappeared and he is making steady progress. An 
ileal neobladderenteric fistula as a long-term postoperative complication of 
ileal neobladder construction is extremely rare, with no other reports to our 
knowledge. Here, we discuss its cause, diagnosis and treatment, with reference 
to previous reports.

BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal 
diversion has been shown to be feasible in a few centers of excellence 
worldwide, with promising functional and oncologic outcomes. However, it remains 
unknown whether the complexity of the procedure allows its duplication in other 
non-pioneer centers. We attempt to address this issue by presenting our 
cumulative experience with RARC and intracorporeal neobladder formation.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 62 RARCs in 50 men and 12 women (mean age 
63.6 years) in two tertiary centers. Intracorporeal Studer neobladders were 
created, duplicating the steps of standard open surgery. Perioperative and 
postoperative variables and complications were analyzed using standardized 
tools. Functional and oncological results were assessed.
RESULTS: The mean operative time was 476.9 min (range, 310 to 690) and blood 
loss was 385 ml (200 to 800). The mean hospital stay was 16.7 (12 to 62) days 
with no open conversion. Perioperative complications were grade II in 15, grade 
III in 11, and grade IV in 5 patients. The mean nodal yield was 22.9 (8 to 46). 
Positive margins were found in in 6.4%. The 90- and 180-day mortality rates were 
0% and 3.3%. The average follow-up was 37.3 months (3 to 52). Continence was 
achieved in 88% of patients. The cancer-specific survival rate and overall 
survival rate were 84% and 71%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A RARC with intracorporeal neobladder creation is safe and 
reproducible in 'non-pioneer' tertiary centers with robotic expertise with 
acceptable operative time and complications. Further standardization of RARC 
with intracorporeal diversion is a prerequisite for its widespread use.

PURPOSE: Patients after radical cystectomy (RC) frequently complain about bowel 
disorders (BDs). Reports addressing related long-term complications are sparse. 
This cross-sectional study assessed changes in bowel habits (BH) after RC.
METHODS: A total of 89 patients with a minimum follow-up ≥1 year after surgery 
were evaluated with a questionnaire. Patients with BD prior to surgery were 
excluded. Symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, bloating/flatulence, 
incomplete defecation, uncontrolled stool loss, and impact on quality of life 
(QoL) were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 46.1 % of patients reported changes in BH; however, only 
25.8 % reported experiencing related dissatisfaction. Primary causes of 
dissatisfaction were diarrhea and uncontrolled stool loss. The most common 
complaints were bloating/flatulence and the feeling of incomplete defecation, 
but these symptoms did not necessarily lead to dissatisfaction or impairment in 
quality of life. No difference was identified between an orthotopic neobladder 
and ileal conduit, and even patients without bowel surgery were affected. QoL, 
health status, and energy level were significantly decreased in unsatisfied 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: About 25 % of patients complain about BDs after RC. More 
prospective studies assessing symptoms, comorbidities, and dietary habits are 
necessary to address this issue and to identify strategies for follow-up 
recommendations.

Neobladder is continent urinary reservoir made from a detubularized segment of 
bowel, with implantation of ureters and urethra. The most common indication for 
this operation is bladder replacement after cystectomy following bladder cancer 
in elderly or cervical cancer Stage IV patients. Nowadays indications are 
expanded to many benign diseases (interstitial cystitis (IC), neurogenic 
bladder, chronic pelvic pain) in reproductive age. Pregnancy in women with 
neobladder is a rare condition, hence published experience is limited. Most of 
the published cases were delivered by cesarean, due to the concern for possible 
complications. The authors report a case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent a 
vesico ileocystoplasty for IC, became pregnant six years after the operation, 
and delivered a healthy baby vaginally. Her obstetric and urologic outcomes were 
assessed, during, and after pregnancy. Careful antenatal monitoring by both an 
obstetrician and a urologist, awareness of potential complications, and their 
prompt treatment, can result in a successful pregnancy and vaginal delivery 
where neither fetus or mother nor neobladder are endangered.

PURPOSE: Recalcitrant posterior urethral stenosis is a challenging disease. When 
combined with a defunctionalized bladder, cutaneous urinary diversion is the 
most common surgical option. We present a novel technique of total lower urinary 
tract reconstruction, combining salvage cystectomy, ileal neobladder formation 
and urethral pull-through, as an orthotopic alternative in patients with a 
defunctionalized bladder and recalcitrant posterior urethral stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We completed a retrospective review of 8 patients who 
underwent salvage cystectomy, orthotopic ileal neobladder formation and urethral 
pull-through. Artificial urinary sphincter placement was performed in a staged 
fashion. Six patients received prostate cancer treatment including radiation 
therapy, 1 had urethral disruption after robotic radical prostatectomy, and 1 
experienced bladder rupture and urethral distraction injury during a motorcycle 
accident. Patient demographics, operative variables and postoperative outcomes 
were examined.
RESULTS: No high grade complications were observed after salvage cystectomy, 
orthotopic neobladder formation and urethral pull-through. After staged 
artificial urinary sphincter placement, a median of 2 revision surgeries (range 
0 to 4) was required to establish social continence. All patients maintained 
functional urinary storage, urethral patency and social continence at a median 
followup of 58 months. No patient had complications related to orthotopic 
neobladder formation, including ureteroileal anastomotic stricture or 
pyelonephritis, and no patient required cutaneous diversion.
CONCLUSIONS: Total lower urinary tract reconstruction with cystectomy, ileal 
neobladder formation and urethral pull-through offers an orthotopic alternative 
for patients with recalcitrant posterior urethral stenosis and defunctionalized 
bladders. Although it requires staged placement of an artificial urinary 
sphincter, this approach can offer functional urinary storage, durable urethral 
patency and avoidance of cutaneous urinary diversion.

PURPOSE: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and intracorporeal urinary 
diversion are only performed in a few centers of excellence worldwide. 
Functional and oncologic outcomes are comparable. We report on our experience 
with RARC and intracorporeal diversion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 86 RARCs in 72 men and 14 
women (mean age 69.7 years). All patients underwent robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by intracorporeal urinary 
diversion using ileal conduit or neobladder. Of the 86 patients, 24 patients 
(28%) underwent intracorporeal ileal conduit and 62 patients (72%) underwent 
intracorporeal neobladder formation. A Studer pouch was created in all who 
underwent intracorporeal neobladder diversion. Cancer specific survival (CSS) 
and overall survival (OS) are reported.
RESULTS: The mean operative time was 418.9 min (range 205-690 min) and blood 
loss was 380 ml (range 100-1000 ml). The mean hospital stay was 17.5 days (range 
5-62 days). All the surgeries were completed with no open conversions. Minor 
complications (grade I and II) were reported in 23 patients, while major 
complications (grade III and above) were reported in 21 patients. The mean nodal 
yield was 20.3 (range 0-46). Positive margins were found in in 8%. The average 
follow-up was 31.5 months (range 3-52 months). Continence could be achieved in 
88% of patients who received an intracorporeal neobladder. The cancer-specific 
survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were 80% and 70%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RARC with intracorporeal diversion seems to be safe and reproducible 
in tertiary centers with robotic expertise. Operative times are acceptable and 
complications as well as functional and oncologic outcomes are comparable. 
Further standardization of RARC with intracorporeal diversion may lead to a 
wider adoption of the approach.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether the ileal length used for the formation of two 
different orthotopic bladder substitutes [Studer (S)-Pouch vs. I-Pouch; 60 vs. 
40 cm] impacts quality of life (QoL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 56 patients 
underwent radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder for bladder cancer [S-Pouch: 
23 pat, 19 men, 4 women); I-Pouch: 33 pat (26 men, 7 women)]. They completed 
general (SF-36), cancer-specific (QLQ-C30) and bladder cancer-specific 
questionnaires (QLQ-BLM30) as well as a novel neobladder-specific questionnaire 
(TNQ). The questionnaire-based follow-up was 66 months (IQR 41-104; total range 
9-161).
RESULTS: I-Pouch patients reported better SF-36 physical health status (p = 
0.026), QLQ-BLM30 continence scores (p < 0.001) and a more favorable QLQ-C30 
total score compared to S-Pouch patients (p = 0.044). S-Pouch patients reported 
better QLQ-BLM30 general health status (p = 0.001). For the TNQ, no significant 
difference was found between both groups (p = 0.09). S-Pouch patients reported 
use of condom urinals more frequently (p = 0.026). S-Pouch patients tended to be 
on vitamin B12 substitution (p = 0.06). I-Pouch patients reported significantly 
higher micturition volumes (≥300 ml) compared to S-Pouch patients (30/33 vs. 
16/23; p = 0.040). No differences were found with regard to bicarbonate 
supplementation and recurrent urinary tract infections.
CONCLUSION: Non-neobladder-specific questionnaires show controversial results 
for QoL outcomes of patients with Studer and I-Pouch. The TNQ suggests that none 
of these two types of neobladder is superior to the other in terms of QoL. 
Hence, general questionnaires are not valid enough to adequately address QoL 
aspects in patients with different neobladders. Development and validation of 
neobladder-specific questionnaires are needed.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In bladder cancer and neuro-bladder, reconstruction of the 
bladder requires bowel segment grafting for augmentation cystoplasty or 
neo-bladder creation. However, even if currently considered as the gold 
standard, it is associated with potentially severe short- and long-term adverse 
effects. Thus, bladder tissue engineering is a promising approach to bladder 
reconstruction.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the last few years, progress has been made with the 
development of new biomaterials for bladder tissue replacement and in 
deciphering the role of stem cells as well as their contribution to bladder 
scaffold integration and tissue regeneration.
SUMMARY: This review of recently published articles allows us to forecast the 
characteristics of efficient and safe bladder biomaterials. However, several 
factors, such as native bladder traits, the specific involvement of urine, and 
bladder tissue replacement indications, have to be assessed with caution before 
including bladder tissue engineering in clinical trials. Many authors agree that 
these challenging techniques could deliver significant benefits with clinical 
application, reducing morbidity and global long-term costs.

cystectomy using 2 ports (2-port LRC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study was performed between November 2011 and 
October 2012 to standardize 2-port LRC, lymph node dissection, and urinary 
diversion. Twenty patients were intervened (8 ileal conduit, 12 neobladder) and 
followed up for >1 yr. Median follow-up was 75.5 weeks (interquartile range, 
65.2-86 weeks). A reusable system placed through the umbilicus and laparoscopic 
curved instruments with double rotation, plus one 10-mm extra port placed in the 
right iliac fossa were used. Neobladder or conduit was performed 
extracorporeally. Preoperative, perioperative, and pathologic outcomes and 
long-term security data are presented.
RESULTS: Median age was 69.5 years; body mass index, 27.4 kg/m(2); operative 
time, 335 minutes; estimated blood loss, 337 mL; hospital stay, 9 days; 
intraoperative transfusion rate, 10%; and visual analog pain score, 3 at day 3. 
Surgical margin was positive in a case (5%); 3 (15%) were pT0, 2 (10%) pT1, 5 
(25%) pT2, 6 (30%) pT3a, 3 (15%) pT3b, and 1 (5%) pT4. The number of nodes 
removed was 18.5 (interquartile range, 16-29.2), 4 (20%) positive. Complications 
were major in 2 (10%; fecal peritonitis and urinary sepsis) and minor in 4 (20%; 
ileus and 3 postoperative transfusion) cases. No case required additional 
analgesia. Incision was totally hidden in the umbilicus. Continence rate in 
neobladders was 91.7% at daytime and 75% at nighttime. Study limitation was the 
absence of a comparative cohort.
CONCLUSION: Umbilical 2-port LRC is feasible with good oncologic and functional 
outcomes, low postoperative pain, and absence of abdominal wall complications. 
Difficulties have slowed laparoendoscopic single-site radical cystectomy, but 
umbilical 2-port LRC is a very acceptable alternative for minimally invasive 
surgery of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates of the available urinary diversion options for 
patients treated with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in different 
settings (pioneering institutions, leading urologic oncology centers, and 
population based).
METHODS: Population-based data from the literature included all patients (n = 
7608) treated in Sweden during the period 1964-2008, from Germany (n = 14,200) 
for the years 2008 and 2011, US patients (identified from National Inpatient 
Sample during 1998-2005, 35,370 patients and 2001-2008, 55,187 patients), and 
from Medicare (n = 22,600) for the years 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2001. After the 
International Consultation on Urologic Diseases-European Association of Urology 
International Consultation on Bladder Cancer 2012, the urinary diversion 
committee members disclosed data from their home institutions (n = 15,867), 
including the pioneering institutions and the leading urologic oncology centers. 
They are the coauthors of this report.
RESULTS: The receipt of continent urinary diversion in Sweden and the United 
States is <15%, whereas in the German high-volume setting, 30% of patients 
receive a neobladder. At leading urologic oncology centers, this rate is also 
30%. At pioneering institutions up to 75% of patients receive an orthotopic 
reconstruction. Anal diversion is <1%. Continent cutaneous diversion is the 
second choice.
CONCLUSION: Enormous variations in urinary diversion exist for >2 decades. 
Increased attention in expanding the use of continent reconstruction may help to 
reduce these disparities for patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder 
cancer. Continent reconstruction should not be the exclusive domain of 
cystectomy centers. Efforts to increase rates of this complex reconstruction 
must concentrate on better definition of the quality-of-life impact, technique 
dissemination, and the centralization of radical cystectomy.

Introduction. Laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery are widely 
performed in urology field, so Hem-o-Lok clips are thus extensively used in the 
laparoscopic procedures. We describe the first case of Hem-o-Lok clip which 
migrated into the neobladder with calculus formation 26 months after 
laparoscopic orthotopic neobladder cystectomy, which causes symptoms of gross 
hematuria and frequent urination. Case Presentation. A 57-year-old man with T2a 
muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent laparoscopic orthotopic sigmoid 
neobladder reconstruction after cystectomy which was complicated by intestinal 
anastomosis leak and peritoneal abscess requiring transverse colostomy and 
drainage 15 days postoperatively. Twenty-six months after cystectomy, he 
complained of gross hematuria and frequent urination. Computerized tomography 
and plain pelvic X-ray revealed a stone measuring approximately 2.8 cm in 
diameter in the neobladder. During cystoscopy, a closed whitish Hem-o-Lok clip 
was seen in the center of the calculi. No anastomotic leak or neoplasm was found 
during cystoscopy. Conclusion. Hem-o-Lok clip migration into the bladder after 
laparoscopic orthotopic neobladder cystectomy is a rare complication; the first 
reported case in the literature. To prevent Hem-o-Lok clip migration, it is 
recommended to avoid extensive use of Hem-o-Lok clip close to anastomosis site, 
and any loose Hem-o-Lok clip should be retrieved before closure.

AIM: The aim of this study is to compare urodynamic and continence parameters 
among patients undergoing orthotropic neo-bladder substitution with sigmoid or 
ileal segments. Variations in the Urodynamic parameter between the continent and 
incontinent patients were also evaluated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2008 to March 2012, 44 patients underwent 
ileal neobladder (IN) reconstruction and 36 patients underwent sigmoid 
neobladder (SN) reconstruction. Evaluation of Urodynamic and Continence 
parameters was performed at 12 months after surgery.
RESULTS: The average capacity of IN and SN was 510 ml and 532 ml respectively. 
The voiding pressure, mean peak flow rates and post void residual urine (PVRU) 
for IN and SN were 27.5 cm H2O versus 37 cm H2O, 15ml/s versus 17ml/s and 36 ml 
versus 25 ml respectively. Daytime continence for IN and SN was 93% (41/44) and 
89% (32/36), and night-time continence was 91% (40/44) and 78% (28/36) 
respectively. The compliance, maximum cystometric capacity and PVRU in the 
daytime continent (versus incontinent) were 61 (versus 41), 471 (versus 651) and 
22 (versus 124) and in the night-time continent (versus incontinent) were 57 
(versus 43), 437 (versus 654) and 18 (versus 105) respectively.
CONCLUSION: A neobladder constructed from detubularized ileum or sigmoid 
achieves urodynamically proven adequate capacity and compliance with 89-93% 
daytime and 78-91% night time continence. Continent men when compared with 
incontinent (both daytime and night time) were more likely to have comparatively 
higher compliance, lower maximum cystometric capacity and lower PVRU. Urodynamic 
study could predict which incontinent men would improve with pelvic floor 
exercises and clean intermittent catheterization (CIC).

Ileal neobladder is the preferred technique in the management of urinary 
diversion postradical cystectomy for bladder malignancy. The common 
complications associated with this procedure are atrophied kidney, chronic 
pyelonephritis, decreased renal function, ureteroileal or urethral anastomotic 
site stricture, urinary tract stones, incontinence, and hyperchloremic metabolic 
acidosis. Mucous plugs are also seen in 2%-3% patients. We present a rare 
presentation of a patient who required hemodialysis for severe hyperkalemia and 
acute kidney injury caused by mucous plugging of ileal neobladder.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection represents the 
standard treatment for muscle-invasive, and high-risk non-muscle-invasive 
bladder cancers. Aim of this study was to report our case series of 30 patients 
undergoing totally laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) with reconstruction of 
an intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder. Intra- and perioperative results 
and the functional and oncological outcomes 9 months after operation are 
reported.
METHODS: Between October 2010 and December 2012, 30 male patients underwent LRC 
with a pure laparoscopic orthotopic ileal "U"- shaped neobladder diversion. The 
men had a median age of 67 years, a median body mass index of 22.3, and a mean 
ASA score of 2.2; they represented various clinical stages of disease.
RESULTS: None of the patients required conversion to open surgery, and no 
perioperative mortalities were reported. The median operating time was 365 min, 
and the median blood loss was 290 mL, with a transfusion rate of 26.6%. All 
surgical margins were negative; 8 patients with non-organ-confined disease or 
positive lymph nodes received adjuvant chemotherapy. Early complications (within 
30 days) occurred in 7 patients, and late complications occurred in 6 patients. 
The mean hospital stay was 9 days. At 9 months after surgery, the daytime 
continence rate was 83.3% and the nighttime continence rate was 73.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Pure LRC with intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder 
reconstruction may represent a viable alternative to open radical cystectomy, 
with a significant reduction in patient morbidity. Future, large, randomized 
controlled trials with extensive follow-up are needed to confirm our encouraging 
results.

We report a case of percutaneous bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) perfusion 
therapy for carcinoma in situ (CIS) of upper urinary tract after radical 
cystectomy with ileal neobladder. A 42-year-old man underwent radical cystectomy 
and ileal neobladder diversion due to the recurrence of CIS in prostatic urethra 
after transurethral resection of bladder tumor 3 times and 2 courses of 
intravesical BCG therapy. Final pathological findings showed the presence of CIS 
in the right distal ureteral margin. After the radical cystectomy, our diagnosis 
was CIS in the right residual ureter, because of positive urine cytology and 
negative radiographic findings in the upper urinary tract. We performed the 
percutaneous BCG perfusion therapy for CIS of the right upper urinary tract 
after the construction of the percutaneous nephrostomy by intentionally inducing 
hydronephrosis. No recurrence was found after 3 years of BCG perfusion therapy.

PURPOSE: The increasing trend of performing radical cystectomy with a minimally 
invasive approach has made stapled neobladders an attractive alternative to 
hand-sewn pouches. To date, data on the incidence and clinical impact of stone 
formation in long surviving neobladder cases are scarce. We report a long-term, 
single-center experience of stapled orthotopic ileal neobladder and identify 
predictors of stone formation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2001 to October 2012, 445 consecutive patients 
(388 male, 57 female) underwent radical cystectomy and stapled orthotopic ileal 
neobladder. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify 
independent predictors of an increased risk of stone formation.
RESULTS: At a median followup of 41 months (IQR 16-58) neobladder stone 
formation occurred in 41 patients (9.2%). All of these patients successfully 
underwent endoscopic stone lithotripsy with 34 as outpatient procedures. On 
univariable Cox analysis only female gender (p = 0.001, HR 3.29, 95% CI 
1.59-6.83) and intermittent self-catheterization (p <0.001, HR 15.2, 95% CI 
5.87-39.5) were associated with an increased risk of stone formation. On 
multivariable analysis the only independent predictor of stone formation was 
intermittent self-catheterization (p = 0.001, HR 8.98, 95% CI 2.59-31.1).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series of stapled orthotopic ileal neobladders the rate of 
stone formation was comparable to that reported in the literature for completely 
hand-sewn ileal reservoirs. The only variable independently predictive of stone 
formation was intermittent self-catheterization.

Comment in
    J Endourol. 2015 Apr;29(4):390.

In recent years, robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) has shown similar 
oncologic outcomes compared with the gold standard open radical cystectomy with 
the added benefit of less blood loss and shorter hospital stay. Robot-assisted 
cystectomy with intracorporeal ileal neobladder is a complex surgical procedure 
and is usually performed in centers with experienced surgeons. We propose 
robot-assisted cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladder using the Y pouch 
previously described in open radical cystectomy. We think that the Y pouch is 
easier to perform than conventional spherical pouches without compromising 
functional outcomes. It may therefore be a good alternative for patients 
undergoing RARC with intracorporeal diversion.

Metabolic bone disease following urinary diversion in adults.

Vyas P(1), Crispen PL.

Author information:
(1)aDepartment of Urology, University of Florida.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Urinary diversions are created following radical cystectomy 
or for the palliation of recalcitrant lower urinary tract symptoms. Chronic 
metabolic acidosis, one of the several long-term complications associated with 
urinary diversion, has been shown to lead to metabolic bone disease if 
untreated.
RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of chronic acidosis can be influenced by several 
factors, including type and length of bowel segment utilized, renal function, 
and type of urinary diversion. The observed rate of acidosis has been noted to 
be high, particularly in patients undergoing continent ileal neobladders using 
long bowel segments. Results from the five selected case series evaluating the 
association between urinary diversion and development of metabolic bone disease 
are inconsistent, but the majority report a low incidence of bone disease, 
ranging from 0 to 15%. In order to decrease the risk of developing metabolic 
bone disease and the other associated disorders, attention to the diagnosis of 
acidosis postoperatively, along with preventive therapy, is crucial. Treatment 
of acidosis secondary to urinary diversion may be accomplished in the long term 
with oral alkalizing agents.
SUMMARY: Although there is no clear relationship between urinary diversion and 
the future development of metabolic bone disease, diagnosis and treatment of 
postoperative acidosis are recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Alvimopan has been shown to improve time to return of bowel 
function in patients undergoing bowel resection. The objective of this study is 
to determine if alvimopan has similar benefits for patients undergoing 
robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All RARC cases were reviewed from January 2008 to March 
2012. All patients during this time were administered alvimopan unless they had 
been receiving narcotics preoperatively. Patients receiving alvimopan received a 
preoperative dose of 12 mg perorally and then were dosed twice daily for 7 days 
or until first bowel movement. Clinicopathologic outcomes were summarized and 
compared, and functional outcomes of treated patients were compared with 
outcomes of untreated patients.
RESULTS: One hundred seventeen RARCs meeting study criteria were performed. All 
urinary diversions used an extracorporeal approach. Urinary diversions consisted 
of 50 Studer neobladders, 22 Indiana pouches, and 45 ileal conduits. Fifty-four 
patients received alvimopan, and 63 did not. The median time to first bowel 
movement was 5 days in the alvimopan group and 6 days in the untreated group 
(P=.03). Median time to solid diet was 6 days in the treated group and 7 days in 
the untreated group (P=.03). There was a trend toward fewer hospital days in the 
alvimopan group (alvimopan, 8 days; untreated, 9 days; P=.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Alvimopan administration appears to reduce the time to return of 
bowel function and initiation of diet following RARC. This was a trend toward 
shorter hospitalization in the alvimopan group. Alvimopan should be considered 
in ongoing research into protocols to aid in shorter convalescence following 
RARC.

University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence, treatment, and outcome of urethral recurrence (UR) 
after radical cystectomy (RC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with orthotopic 
neobladder in women have rarely been addressed in the literature.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients (median age at recurrence: 60 
years) who experienced UR after RC with an orthotopic neobladder were selected 
for this study from a cohort of 456 women from participating institutions. The 
primary clinical and pathological characteristics at RC, including the 
manifestation of the UR and its treatment and outcome, were reviewed.
RESULTS: The primary bladder tumors in the 12 patients were urothelial carcinoma 
in 8 patients, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in 1 patient each, and 
mixed histology in 2 patients. Three patients (25%) had lymph node-positive 
disease at RC. The median time from RC to the detection of UR was 8 months 
(range 4-55). Eight recurrences manifested with clinical symptoms and 4 were 
detected during follow-up or during a diagnostic work-up for clinical symptoms 
caused by distant metastases. Treatment modalities were surgery, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, and bacillus Calmette-Guérin urethral instillations. Nine patients 
died of cancer. The median survival after the diagnosis of UR was 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: UR after RC with an orthotopic neobladder in females is rare. 
Solitary, noninvasive recurrences have a favorable prognosis when detected 
early. Invasive recurrences are often associated with local and distant 
metastases and have a poor prognosis.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine preoperative patients' 
characteristics associated with the urinary diversion (UD) type (continent vs. 
incontinent) after radical cystectomy (RC) and UD-associated postoperative 
complications.
MATERIALS: In 2011, 679 bladder cancer patients underwent RC at 18 European 
tertiary care centers. Data were prospectively collected within the 'PROspective 
MulticEnTer RadIcal Cystectomy Series 2011' (PROMETRICS 2011). Logistic 
regression models assessed the impact of preoperative characteristics on UD type 
and evaluated diversion-related complication rates.
RESULTS: Of 570 eligible patients, 28.8, 2.6, 59.3, and 9.3% received orthotopic 
neobladders, continent cutaneous pouches, ileal conduits, and 
ureterocutaneostomies, respectively. In multivariable analyses, female sex (odds 
ratio [OR] 3.9; p = 0.002), American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3 (OR 
2.3; p = 0.02), an age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥3 (OR 4.1; p < 
0.001), and a positive biopsy of the prostatic urethra in the last transurethral 
resection of the bladder prior to RC (OR 4.9; p = 0.03) were independently 
associated with incontinent UD. There were no significant differences in 30- 
and/or 90-day complication rates between the UD types. Perioperative transfusion 
rates and 90-day mortality were significantly associated with incontinent UD (p 
< 0.001, respectively). Limitations included the small sample size and a certain 
level of heterogeneity in the application of clinical pathways between the 
different participating centers.
CONCLUSIONS: Within this prospective contemporary cohort of European RC patients 
treated at tertiary care centers, the majority of patients received an 
incontinent UD. Female sex and pre-existing comorbidities were associated with 
receiving an incontinent UD. The risk of overall complications did not vary 
according to UD type.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the medium and long-term outcome of orthotopic continent 
urinary diversion with ileal (Studer) neo-bladder following radical cystectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Surgery, The Aga Khan University 
Hospital, Karachi, from January 1998 to September 2010.
METHODOLOGY: Thirty eight patients underwent radical cystectomy for invasive 
bladder tumor with ileal neo-bladder (Studer type) reconstruction. 
Peri-operative and late complications, functional outcome of neo-bladder, 
urinary continence, metabolic and upper urinary tract status and overall 
survival were evaluated in all patients.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (23 males and 6 females) with mean age of 59 ± 
12 years were included for the final analysis. The mean duration of surgery 
(both radical cystectomy and urinary diversion) was 520 ± 70 minutes. 
Perioperative complication rate was 24% (n=7) with surgical site infection in 4 
patients, sepsis in 1 patient and 2 had ureteroileal leak. At 6 months 
follow-up, 22 patients were fully continent while 7 patients had minimal stress 
/ nocturnal incontinence. The continence rate was 93% (n=27) at one year 
follow-up. The mean capacity of neo-bladder at 6 months was 384 ± 66 mLs. The 
late complication rate was 17% (n=5). Three patients developed anastomotic 
stricture requiring transurethral incision of neo bladder neck, one formed stone 
in neo-bladder and one developed incision hernia. All patients had preserved 
renal functions on follow-up. The survival rate was 80% (n=23) at a median 
follow-up of 66.4 ± 36 months. Two patients developed local recurrence and four 
developed distant metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Studer ileal neo-bladder is a safe and effective option for urinary 
diversion in select patients with good oncological and functional outcomes 
comparable to contemporary literature, even in a low volume center.

The long-term urodynamics of laparoscopic radical cystectomy with orthotopic 
ileal neobladder for bladder cancer remain unclear in the clinical setting. The 
present prospective observational study was conducted between January 2010 and 
December 2012 to evaluate the 6-month and 12-month follow-up data of urodynamic 
changes of bladder cancer patients who were initially treated by laparoscopic 
radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder. A total of 53 eligible 
patients were included, and all patients were followed up for at least 12 
months, with a median time of 18 months. During the follow-up period, no 
patients reported difficulty urinating, and the daily frequency of urination and 
the urine output were gradually improved with time. Dynamic urodynamic 
examinations showed that the maximum flow rate (11.4±1.1 vs. 7.3±1.4 ml/sec; 
P<0.001), residual urine content (22.8±10.5 vs. 40.7±12.7 ml; P<0.001), maximum 
bladder capacity (373.8±62.2 vs. 229.7±56.3 ml; P<0.001) and maximum bladder 
pressure during filling (35.8±6.7 vs. 26.4±7.0 cm H2O; P<0.001) at 12 months 
were all improved significantly compared with that at 6 months after the initial 
surgical treatment. However, there were no significant differences in maximum 
bladder pressure during voiding (75.7±24.7 vs. 73.1±24.7 cm H2O; P=0.618) and 
bladder compliance (26.9±13 vs. 27.4±13.1 cm H2O; P=0.848) at 12 and 6 months 
after initial surgical treatment. In conclusion, the urodynamics of this 
orthotopic ileal neobladder gradually improve, and its long-term urine storage 
and voiding functions are acceptable.

PURPOSE: We determined the likelihood that transurethral resection biopsy of the 
prostatic urethra adjacent to the verumontanum would detect prostatic 
involvement of urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared precystectomy transurethral resection biopsy 
specimens of the prostatic urethra with those of the matched radical 
cystoprostatectomy in 272 patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. All 
prostates were evaluated by whole mount step sections.
RESULTS: Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma was detected by 
transurethral resection biopsy or radical cystoprostatectomy in 101 patients 
(37.1%). Transurethral resection biopsy detected urothelial carcinoma in 72 
cases with 71.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The overall accuracy of 
transurethral resection biopsy to detect urothelial carcinoma of the prostate 
was 89% (positive and negative predictive values 100% and 86%, respectively). 
Invasive prostatic urothelial carcinoma arising from the prostatic urethra was 
detected by transurethral resection biopsy in 21 of 26 patients (81%) while 
prostatic carcinoma in situ was detected in 39 of 52 (75%). Transurethral 
resection biopsy detected prostatic invasive urothelial carcinoma resulting from 
transmural invasion of a bladder tumor in 4 of 15 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma of the bladder was 
found in 37.1% of patients. Transurethral resection biopsy missed most tumors 
resulting from transmural invasion of the bladder primary lesion. Carcinoma in 
situ and invasive urothelial carcinoma arising from the prostatic urethra were 
detected in most cases. Transurethral resection biopsy of the prostatic urethra 
can complement staging and support clinical decision making with respect to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and planning for an orthotopic neobladder.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this report is to describe our surgical technique of 
totally intracorporeal robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with 
neobladder formation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2003 and March 2013, a total of 147 
patients (118 male, 29 female) underwent totally intracorporeal RARC for urinary 
bladder cancer. We also performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase and 
PubMed databases using the terms RARC, robotic cystectomy, robot-assisted, 
totally intracorporeal RARC, intracorporeal neobladder, intracorporeal urinary 
diversion, oncological outcomes, functional outcomes, and complication rates.
RESULTS: The mean age of our patients was 64 years (range 37-87). On surgical 
pathology 47% had pT1 or less disease, 27% had pT2, 16% had pT3 and 10% had pT4. 
The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 21 (range 0-60). 24% of patients had 
lymph node positive dAQ1isease. Positive surgical margins occurred in 6 cases 
(4%). Mean follow-up was 31 months (range 4-115 months). Two patients (1.4%) 
died within 90 days of their operation. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, overall 
survival and cancer specific survival at 60 months was 68% and 69.6%, 
respectively. 80 patients (54%) received a continent diversion with totally 
intracorporeal neobladder formation. In the neobladder subgroup median total 
operating time was 420 minutes (range 265-760). Daytime continence and 
satisfactory sexual function or potency at 12 months ranged between 70-90% in 
both men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with totally intracorporeal RARC demonstrates 
acceptable oncological and functional outcomes that suggest this is a viable 
alternative to open radical cystectomy.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy is the gold-standard treatment for 
muscle-invasive and refractory nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. We describe 
our technique for robotic radical cystectomy (RRC) and intracorporeal urinary 
diversion (ICUD), that replicates open surgical principles, and present our 
preliminary results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specific descriptions for preoperative planning, surgical 
technique, and postoperative care are provided. Demographics, perioperative and 
30-day complications data were collected prospectively and retrospectively 
analyzed. Learning curve trends were analyzed individually for ileal conduits 
(IC) and neobladders (NB). SAS(®) Software Version 9.3 was used for statistical 
analyses with statistical significance set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Between July 2010 and September 2013, RRC and lymph node dissection 
with ICUD were performed in 103 consecutive patients (orthotopic NB=46, IC 57). 
All procedures were completed robotically replicating the open surgical 
principles. The learning curve trends showed a significant reduction in hospital 
stay for both IC (11 vs. 6-day, P < 0.01) and orthotopic NB (13 vs. 7.5-day, P < 
0.01) when comparing the first third of the cohort with the rest of the group. 
Overall median (range) operative time and estimated blood loss was 7 h (4.8-13) 
and 200 mL (50-1200), respectively. Within 30-day postoperatively, complications 
occurred in 61 (59%) patients, with the majority being low grade (n = 43), and 
no patient died. Median (range) nodes yield was 36 (0-106) and 4 (3.9%) 
specimens had positive surgical margins.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic radical cystectomy with totally ICUD is safe and feasible. 
It can be performed using the established open surgical principles with 
encouraging perioperative outcomes.

PURPOSE: Prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomies are alternative 
procedures for bladder cancer that may decrease morbidity while achieving cancer 
control. However, to our knowledge the comparative effectiveness of these 
approaches has not been established. We evaluated functional and oncologic 
outcomes in patients undergoing these procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single institution trial in patients with 
bladder cancer in whom transurethral prostatic urethral biopsy and transrectal 
prostate biopsy were negative. Men were randomized to prostate capsule sparing 
or nerve sparing cystectomy with neobladder creation and stratified by Sexual 
Health Inventory for Men score (greater than 21 vs 21 or less). Our primary end 
point was 12-month overall urinary function as measured by Bladder Cancer Index. 
Secondary end points included sexual function, cancer control and complications.
RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study with 20 patients in 
each arm. Urinary function at 12 months decreased by 13 and 28 points in the 
prostate capsule and nerve sparing groups, respectively (p = 0.10). Sexual 
function followed a similar pattern (p = 0.06). There was no difference in 
recurrence-free, metastasis-free or overall survival (each p >0.05). The rate of 
incidentally detected prostate cancer was similar (p = 0.15).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a randomized comparison of prostate capsule 
sparing and nerve sparing cystectomy techniques. We found no difference in 
functional or oncologic outcomes between the 2 approaches, although our study 
was underpowered due to a lack of patient accrual.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of the length of the ureter resected and other 
clinical variables on ureterointestinal anastomotic (UIA) stricture rate 
following radical cystectomy and ileal segment urinary diversion.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 519 consecutive patients who underwent 
cystectomy and ileal conduit or ileal orthotopic neobladder diversion from 
January 2007 to August 2012. The length of the ureter resected was defined as 
the length of the ureter in the cystectomy specimen plus the length of the 
distal ureter submitted for pathologic analysis. The primary end point was the 
risk of UIA stricture formation, assessed by Cox proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 463 patients met the inclusion criteria with complete data. 
Median follow-up was 459 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 211-927). Median time 
to stricture formation was 235 (IQR: 134-352) and 232 days (IQR: 132-351) on the 
right and the left ureter, respectively. Overall stricture rate per ureter was 
5.9% on the right vs. 10.0% on the left (P = 0.03). There was no difference in 
demographic, operative, or perioperative variables between patients with and 
without UIA strictures. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, 
anastomosis technique (running vs. interrupted), and length of ureter resected, 
only a Clavien complication≥III (hazard ratio = 2.11, 1.01-4.40) and urine leak 
(hazard ratio = 3.37, 1.08-10.46) significantly predicted for left- and 
right-sided stricture formation, respectively. The length of the ureter resected 
did not predict UIA stricture formation on either side.
CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of benign UIA strictures following ileal urinary 
diversion is likely multifactorial. Our data suggest that a complicated 
postoperative course and urine leak are risk factors for UIA stricture 
formation. The length of the distal ureter resected did not significantly affect 
stricture rate.

PURPOSE: We present a 2-institution experience with completely intracorporeal 
robotic orthotopic ileal neobladder after radical cystectomy in 132 patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Established open surgical techniques were duplicated 
robotically with all neobladders suture constructed intracorporeally in a 
globular configuration. Nerve sparing was performed in 56% of males. 
Lymphadenectomy was extended (up to aortic bifurcation in 51, 44%) and 
superextended (up to the inferior mesenteric artery in 20, 17%). Ureteroileal 
anastomoses were Wallace-type (86, 65%) or Bricker-type (46, 35%). The learning 
curve at each institution was assessed using chronological subgroups and by 
trends across the entire cohort. Data were prospectively collected and 
retrospectively queried.
RESULTS: Mean operating time was 7.6 hours (range 4.4 to 13), blood loss was 430 
cc (range 50 to 2,200) and hospital stay was 11 days (median 8, range 3 to 78). 
Clavien grade I, II, III, IV and V complications within 30 days were 7%, 25%, 
13%, 2% and 0%, respectively, and between 30 and 90 days were 5%, 9%, 11%, 1% 
and 2%, respectively. Mean nodal yield was 29 (range 7 to 164) and the node 
positivity rate was 17%. Operative time, blood loss, hospital stay and 
prevalence of late complications improved with experience. During a mean 
followup of 2.1 years (range 0.1 to 9.8) cancer recurred in 20 patients (15%). 
Five-year overall, cancer specific and recurrence-free survival was 72%, 72% and 
71%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a refined technique of robotic intracorporeal 
orthotopic neobladder diversion, duplicating open principles. Operative 
efficiency and outcomes improved with experience. Going forward, we propose a 
prospective randomized comparison between open and robotic intracorporeal 
neobladder surgery.

OBJECTIVE: Probably, laparoscopic radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder and 
neovesicourethral anastomosis is one of the most complex procedures in minimally 
invasive surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study carried out in 72 patients surgically 
treated for invasive bladder neoplasia between January 2008 and October 2013. 
Patients were undergone to radical cystectomy with ileal neobladder (open 
approach in 33 patients and laparoscopic approach in 39). The study assessed 
comparatively surgical outcomes, continence rate and postoperative 
complications.
RESULTS: Mean age was 63.5±9 years (64.3 open vs. 62.7 laparoscopic, P=.46) mean 
surgery time 323.6±78.7 minutes (321.3 vs. 326.5, P=.77), average hospital stay 
14.8 days±8,1 (16.2 vs. 13.6, P=.2), transfusion rate 40.3% (66.7% vs. 17.9%, 
P<.0001) and complications rate 47.2% (63.6% vs. 33.3%, P=.01). Major 
complications were reported in 29.1% of cases (39.4% open vs. 20,5% 
laparoscopic, P=.07). With a mean follow-up rate of 42.5±19.2 months (range 
15-70), 50 (69.4%) patients remain alive and free of disease. Continence was 
evaluated in these patients: total continence rate was 38% (50% vs. 27%, P=.09) 
and diurnal continence rate 58% (70.8% vs. 46.1%, P=.07). Self-catheterization 
rate was 8% (4.2% vs. 11.5%, P=.67). Total incontinence rate was 34% (25% vs. 
42.3%, P=.19).
CONCLUSION: According to our experience, transfusion rate, number and severity 
of complications are lower in laparoscopic cystectomy with ileal neobladder. No 
statistically significant impact on operative time and on hospital stay was 
observed. In patients undergone to laparoscopic approach, continence rate is 
lower but not statistically significant.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with lymph node-positive urothelial carcinoma of the 
bladder generally have a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, long-term survival in up 
to 30% of patients is reported. In the absence of established prognostic 
molecular markers, an assessment of the prognosis with clinical parameters is 
mandatory.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients from one high-volume center with a curatively 
intended cystectomy for lymph node-positive urothelial carcinoma were evaluated. 
Patients' overall and cancer-specific survival were correlated with 
clinicopathological parameters. Pathological lymph node staging was performed 
with both the 2002 and 2010 TNM classification of the AJCC.
RESULTS: Lack of a perioperative chemotherapy (p < 0.001), higher numbers of 
positive nodes (p = 0.002), a higher lymph node density (p = 0.003), a higher 
pathological T stage (p = 0.006) and urinary diversion with an ileal conduit 
compared to an ileal neobladder (p = 0.023) were prognostic of a shorter overall 
survival while the number of removed lymph nodes showed no significant 
association with survival. Both with the 2002 and 2010 TNM classifications 
patients staged pN1 had a longer overall survival and time to cancer-specific 
death in comparison to patients with more extensive lymph node disease. 
According to the 2002 classification, there was a significant survival 
difference between patients with lymph node metastases in regional and distant 
lymph nodes.
DISCUSSION: Patients with a low lymph node density and an early pT stage present 
with the best prognosis among LN positive patients. The value of perioperative 
chemotherapy is emphasized. Which lymph node metastases are to be considered 
regional or distant remains a matter of debate.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the pre, intra, and post-operative data between ileal 
conduit and neobladder urinary diversions during laparoscopic radical 
cystectomy(LRC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2011, 63 patients who underwent LRC and 
urinary diversion had their data input prospectively into a database and said 
data used for the analysis. The outcome comparators were the patient 
demographics, operative time, conversion rate, blood loss, transfusion rate, 
morphine analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay, complication rates, 
follow up, and quality of life assessments. A Mantel-Haenszel test was used for 
dichotomous data and an inverse variance method was used for continuous data. P 
values less than 0.5 were considered significant.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (60 ±7.11 years) had ileal conduits and 24 
patients (57 ±8.68 years) had neobladder urinary diversion. No difference was 
found (P >0.05) regarding age, BMI, smoking history, TURBT pathology result, 
blood loss, blood transfusion requirement, conversion rates, length of hospital 
stay, morphine requirement, complications, or follow-up and quality of life. The 
neobladder groups did have more previous abdominal operations and had 
significantly longer operative time.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no difference between either types of diversion in all 
comparative aspects except that the neobladder had longer operative times. This 
is the first comparative study between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary 
diversion after laparoscopic radical cystectomy and can pose as a bench mark for 
future comparisons.

OBJECTIVES: To present time-efficiency data during our initial experience with 
intracorporeal urinary diversion and technical tips that may shorten operative 
time early in the learning curve.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed in the initial 37 consecutive patients 
undergoing robotic radical cystectomy and intracorporeal urinary diversion in 
whom detailed stepwise operative time data were available. Median age was 65 
years and median body mass index was 27. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 
administered in 6 patients and 11 patients had clinical evidence of T3 or lymph 
node-positive disease. Each component of the operation was subdivided into 
specific steps and operative time for each step was prospectively recorded. 
Peri-operative and follow-up data up to 90 days and final pathological data were 
recorded.
RESULTS: All procedures were completed intracorporeally and robotically without 
need for conversion to open surgery or extracorporeal diversion. Median total 
operative time was 387 vs 386 minutes (p=0.2) and median total console time was 
361 vs 295 minutes (p<0.007) for orthotopic neobladder and ileal conduit, 
respectively. Median time for radical cystectomy was 77 minutes, extended pelvic 
lymph node dissection was 63 minutes, and diversion was 111 minutes (ileal 
conduit 92 minutes and orthotopic neobladder 124 minutes). Median estimated 
blood loss was 250 mL, and median hospital stay was 9 days. High grade (Clavien 
grade 3-5) complications at 30 and 90 days follow-up were recorded in 6 (16%) 
and 9 (24%) patients, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 16 months, 12 
(32%) patients experienced disease recurrence and 9 (24%) died from bladder 
cancer. These correspond to 1-year recurrence-free and overall survival of 64% 
and 70%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracorporeal urinary diversion following robotic radical 
cystectomy can be safely performed and reproducible in a time-efficient manner 
even during the early learning curve.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion carries a high morbidity. 
Quality of life and body image are important considerations for urinary 
diversion (UD). We wanted to conduct a systematic review of literature to see 
which form UD offers a better quality of life (QoL).
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane library 
for studies using the following key words: 'quality of life' and 'ileal 
conduit', 'orthotopic neobladder', 'continent diversion' and 'urinary 
diversion'. All English language articles on UD surgery were included in the 
original search from 1990 to 2014. To improve the quality of evidence, we 
stratified our inclusion criteria into studies that report on QoL in both forms 
of UD using at least one validated questionnaire.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (2285 patients) were included in our study all of 
which used at least one validated tool. The most frequently used tools were the 
SF-36, EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT BL (10, 8, 5 studies respectively). None of the 
studies were randomised and only 4 studies were prospectively designed. Sixteen 
studies reported no difference in QoL between the two types of urinary diversion 
and four studies reported a better QoL with orthotopic neobladder of which 2 
studies had younger and fitter patients. On the other hand, one study reported a 
better QoL in ileal conduit patients.
CONCLUSION: Orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion shows a marginally better 
quality of life scores compared to ileal conduit diversion especially when 
considering younger and fitter patients.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the complications and quality of life after cystectomies 
performed in women with bladder cancer at our hospital.
METHODS: Descriptive analysis of demographic data and early/late complications 
of cystectomies and urinary diversions performed in women at our hospital 
between 1990-2010. We also assessed quality of life using the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder Cancer (ACT-BL) questionnaire and a 
comparison was drawn between groups of clinical variables.
RESULTS: Out of 265 cystectomies, 25 (10%) were performed in women. The 
predominant urinary diversion was ureterosigmoidostomy (60%), followed by 
cutaneous ureterostomy (16%), orthotopic ileal neo-bladder Studer pouch (12%), 
ileal conduit (10%) and permanent nephrostomy (4%). Mean age was 55.75 years. 
The most commonly occurring early complications were prolonged ileus (20%) and 
urinary fistula (20%). Late complications included hydronephrosis (32%) and 
pyelonephritis (32%). The results of quality of life questionnaires were very 
similar for the different types of urinary diversions, with a mean score of 
104.5 out of 156 points.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical cystectomy is a high-risk procedure associated with many 
complications. In women, ureterosigmoidostomy may be a good choice for urinary 
diversion in selected patients, with a quality of life very similar to those 
with different urinary diversions.

Urinary diversion: long-term functional aspects.

Cerruto MA(1).

Author information:

Italy.

Functional aspects and quality of life (QOL) of patients with a urinary 
diversion (UD) represent important issues in Urology. Any form of UD has its 
specific problems. In experienced hands and with regular long-term follow-up, 
serious complications can be avoided and excellent long-term results can be 
achieved. Thus, the selection of an appropriate UD is critical to patient's 
long-term satisfaction. Patients must be fully counseled in all types of UD and 
should have ready access to all options. There are 3 kinds of factors to be 
considered in the selection of UD: patient, physician, and general factors. In 
the pre-operative counseling, it is mandatory to explain all factors that over 
time may contribute to affect the patient's urinary tract function and QOL, 
mainly linked to long-term complications of UD. One of the most important 
requirements for any bladder substitution is that it should not jeopardize the 
renal function. There are many urological and non-urological potential reasons 
for deterioration in renal function following UD. Continence results after 
neobladder (NB) are difficult to compare between series published in the 
literature because of a lack of consensus of definitions, varied follow-up 
periods, and different mechanisms of data collection. In up to 22% of patients 
with NB, significant residual urine volumes were observed. The overall patients' 
QOL reported in most articles was good, irrespective of the type of UD. QOL of 
patients with a well functioning NB seems to be significantly better than other 
forms of diversion. Well-designed randomized prospective trials are warranted to 
render definitive conclusions.

PURPOSE: Literature surrounding Indiana pouch (IP) urinary diversion suggests a 
higher incidence of complications and longer operative time compared with ileal 
conduit (IC) and neobladder (NB). We sought to assess short-term complications 
of IP diversions compared with other diversions at our institution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement 
Program data, we identified radical cystectomy cases performed for bladder 
cancer at Indiana University from January 2011 until June 2013. During this time 
period, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program randomly evaluated 
approximately 70% of radical cystectomies performed for urothelial carcinoma at 
our institution. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify 
factors associated with Clavien grade III-V complications.
RESULTS: A total of 233 cases were identified, 139 IC, 39 IP, and 55 NB. Mean 
(standard deviation) operative times for IC, IP, and NB were 257 (84), 383 (78), 
and 327 (88) minutes, respectively (P<0.001). Half of the patients required 
blood transfusion during the hospitalization. The overall rate of complications 
was significantly lower among NB (P = 0.009). Overall, 12% of patients developed 
a Clavien grade III-V complication, with no difference observed between groups 
(P = 0.884). After controlling for preoperative confounders, IP patients were 
not at increased odds of developing a Clavien III-V complication compared with 
IC (odds ratio = 1.38, P = 0.599).
CONCLUSIONS: At a high-volume center, the incidence of serious complications was 
similar between diversion types. IP patients were more likely to experience 
minor complications. Patients should be counseled regarding rates of short-term 
complications and blood transfusion.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the mid-long-term efficacies of orthotopic urinary 
diversion in women.
METHODS: From February 2003 to August 2012, 28 female patients with bladder 
cancer underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal neobladder.Open (n = 
18) and laparoscopic (n = 9) procedures were performed.Ileal neobladder included 
17 T-pouch and 11 modified Studer pouch reconstruction. The continence status, 
urodynamics, serum electrolyte and renal function were followed up.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 55 (8-114) months.Excellent continence 
was achieved during day-time in 82.1%, 92.3% and 90.5% cases at 6, 12 and 24 
months postoperatively and in 53.6%, 88.5% and 90.5% cases at night 
respectively. The mean capacity of pouch was 282 ± 87, 345 ± 72 and 357 ± 75 ml 
at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively respectively. The mean filling pressure 
of pouch was 10.8 ± 3.2, 6.7 ± 2.6 and 6.2 ± 2.1 cmH₂O postoperatively 
respectively.One case of neobladder-vaginal fistula was cured by surgical 
repair. Another case of urethral stenosis responded well after regular dilation 
for 6 months.Renal function and electrolyte metabolism were stable in all cases. 
There was no instance of tumor recurrence or metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Orthotopic urinary diversion in females has excellent long-term 
results with fewer complications so that it is highly recommended.

Neobladders and continent catheterizable stomas for the bladder cancer survivor.

James AC(1), Lin DW, Wright JL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, 
Washington, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following radical 
cystectomy for bladder cancer is an important outcome measure following radical 
cystectomy. Understanding HRQOL issues related to continent urinary diversion is 
crucial in the care and counseling of patients undergoing radical cystectomy. 
The goals of this review are to give a broad overview of the major types of 
continent urinary diversions and to review recent literature examining HRQOL in 
patients undergoing orthotopic neobladders and continent catheterizable urinary 
reservoirs following radical cystectomy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Generic questionnaires that broadly address physical, social, 
and mental functioning and bladder cancer-specific questionnaires that more 
specifically address urinary, bowel, and sexual function have been utilized to 
measure HRQOL following radical cystectomy. Although existing studies indicate 
that overall quality of life may be similar in patients with continent and 
noncontinent urinary diversions, more specific comparisons of urinary and sexual 
function are conflicting and complicated by sex-specific concerns. Uterine 
preservation may improve urinary function in women with continent urinary 
diversions.
SUMMARY: Although the development of disease-specific validated questionnaires 
has improved our understanding of HRQOL following radical cystectomy, a lack of 
prospective studies limits conclusions regarding the superiority of diversion 
type. Appropriate preoperative consultation may facilitate realistic 
expectations, thereby optimizing outcomes.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Venothrombolic events (VTEs) following radical 
cystectomy (RC) are a significant contributor to postoperative morbidity. A 
better understanding of the incidence and timing of VTE would clarify 
chemoprophylaxis strategies among RC patients. We sought to characterize the 
burden of VTE after RC by defining their timing and effect utilizing the 
MarketScan commercial databases.
METHODS: From MarketScan databases, we identified patients younger than 65 years 
undergoing RC for a primary diagnosis of bladder cancer between 2008 and 2011 
with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition diagnosis and 
procedure codes. MarketScan includes inpatient and outpatient health insurance 
claims of 34 million enrollees annually with data from 150 employers and 13 
commercial health plans. We identified the occurrence of VTE, including both 
pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, in patients undergoing RC by 
searching MarketScan for relevant International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
Edition codes for these diagnoses. Our primary outcome of interest was the 
timing of VTEs. Multivariate logistical regression models were used to identify 
patient factors that were associated with VTEs.
RESULTS: A total of 1,581 patients were included in our analysis. Overall, 10% 
of patients experienced VTEs within 90 days of RC. The incidence of 
postoperative VTEs during the index admission, after discharge and within 30 
days of surgery, and between 31 and 90 days postoperatively was 2.9%, 3.8%, and 
3.3%, respectively. Prolonged index hospitalization, discharge to a skilled 
nursing facility, and orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion were significantly 
associated with VTE within 30 days of RC.
CONCLUSION: Most VTEs occur after discharge from the index RC hospitalization. 
Consideration should be given to extended chemoprophylaxis in this high-risk 
group of patients.

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: More recently laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) 
has increasingly been an attractive alternative to open radical cystectomy (ORC) 
and many centers have reported their early experiences in the treatment of 
bladder cancer. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of LRC compared with ORC in the 
treatment of bladder cancer.
METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was 
performed up to Mar 1, 2013. Outcomes of interest assessing the two techniques 
included demographic and clinical baseline characteristics, perioperative, 
pathologic and oncological variables, and post-op neobladder function and 
complications.
RESULTS: Sixteen eligible trials evaluating LRC vs ORC were identified including 
seven prospective and nine retrospective studies. Although LRC was associated 
with longer operative time (p<0.001), patients might benefit from significantly 
fewer overall complications (p<0.001), less blood loss (p<0.001), shorter length 
of hospital stay (p<0.001), less need of blood transfusion (p<0.001), less 
narcotic analgesic requirement (p<0.001), shorter time to ambulation (p = 0.03), 
shorter time to regular diet (p<0.001), fewer positive surgical margins 
(p = 0.006), fewer positive lymph node (p = 0.05), lower distant metastasis rate 
(p = 0.05) and fewer death (p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in 
other demographic parameters except for a lower ASA score (p = 0.01) in LRC 
while post-op neobladder function were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that LRC appears to be a safe, feasible and 
minimally invasive alternative to ORC with reliable perioperative safety, 
pathologic & oncologic efficacy, comparable post-op neobladder function and 
fewer complications. Because of the inherent limitations of the included 
studies, further large sample prospective, multi-centric, long-term follow-up 
studies and randomized control trials should be undertaken to confirm our 
findings.

[Total cystectomy and W-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder for bladder cancer].

[Article in Chinese]

Changsha 410013, China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect of total cystectomy and W-shaped 
orthotopic ileal neobladder for bladder cancer.
METHODS: Total cystectomy and W-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder were 
performed on 29 male patients and 3 female patients. After the cystectomy, 35-40 
cm terminal ileal segment was isolated to make W-shaped orthotopic ileal 
neobladder. Bilateral uretero-ileal anastomoses were constructed by nipple 
technique, urethral stump was sutured to the lowest portion of the ileal pouch.
RESULTS: All surgeries were completed successfully. Patients were able to void 
by increasing the abdominal pressure, daytime continence rate was 87.5% and 
nighttime continence rate was 78.1%. The mean neobladder capacity was 410.6 mL 
and the mean postvoid residual urine was 22.7 mL at 6 months. After the surgery, 
ileal neobladder leakage occurred in 3 (9.4%) patients, mild ileus occurred in 2 
(6.3%) patients, ileo-urethral anastomosis stricture developed in 1(3.1%) 
patient, and dysuria occurred in 3 (9.4%) patients because of the mucus. THe 
complications were treated properly and satisfactory results were obtained. 
Erection was preserved in 5 of the 9 male patients with normal erectile 
function, and normal sexual function was preserved in 1 female patient who 
underwent uterus-sparing cystectomy. The mean follow-up was 15 months. One 
patient died of distant metastasis and pneumonia, while other patients survived 
without tumor.
CONCLUSION: Total cystectomy and W-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder have the 
advantages of voiding through the native urethra, satisfactory continence, low 
complication rates of upper urinary tract damage and electrolyte imbalance. 
W-shaped orthotopic ileal neobladder may be considered as the first option of 
urinary diversion after cystectomy. Postoperative management should focus on

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and risk factors of 
upper urinary tract recurrence (UUTR) following radical cystectomy (RC) in 
bladder cancer and to evaluate its relationship with neobladder (Neo) or ileal 
conduit (IC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All clinicopathologic parameters and perioperative 
parameters of 311 patients who underwent RC with either Neo or IC by a single 
surgeon from 1999 to 2012 were retrospectively included in this study. Patients 
with a history of renal surgery, concomitant UUTR, or a histopathology of 
non-transitional cell carcinoma were excluded. For statistical analyses of 
predictive risk factors of UUTR, a multivariate analysis was performed with 
known risk factors of UUTR, including type of urinary diversion with 
significance defined as P < 0.05.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 53 months, 143 (46.0%) IC and 168 
(54.0%) Neo were performed, resulting in 11 (3.5%) cases of UUTR (Neo 7 and IC 
4) after RC and all patients then underwent nephroureterectomy. No significant 
differences in incidence and overall survival in UUTR were observed according 
different types of urinary diversion (p = 483), and the prognosis for survival 
of Neo was insignificantly better than that of IC (5-year overall survival 78% 
vs 74%, respectively, p>0.05). Higher number of positive lymph nodes (HR 9.03) 
and the presence of pelvic local recurrence (HR 7286.08) were significant 
predictive factors of UUTR (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study reports a UUTR rate of 3.5%, and positive lymph nodes and 
presence of local recurrence at the pelvis as important risk factors. No 
significant differences in incidence and survival were observed between Neo and 
IC.

OBJECTIVE: We report on the short and late morbidity and mortality of ileal 
conduit and neobladder after radical cystectomy with their associated risk 
factors.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on 308 non-metastatic bladder cancer 
patients who underwent radical cystectomy with either ileal conduit or 
neobladder for a curative intent from January 1999 to December 2011. 
Post-operative morbidity and mortality of 30-day (early) and 90-day (late) 
complication with their risk factors were examined in association with different 
types of urinary diversion. A comparative analysis using propensity-score 
matching was performed with matching variables of age, sex, number of underlying 
diseases and pathologic T and N stages, lymph node dissection, operative time 
and time of surgical year for comparison of the early and late morbidities 
between ileal conduit and neobladder.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 46.6 months, early and late morbidities 
were 29.5% (n=91) and 19.8% (n=61), and complication-related mortalities were 
2.2 and 6.6%, respectively. The type of urinary diversion significantly affected 
only the late complications (early: neobladder 57 vs. ileal conduit 47, P=0.096; 
late: neobladder 67 vs. ileal conduit 37, P<0.001). However, after 
propensity-score matching, no significant differences in early and late 
morbidities were observed between neobladder and ileal conduit. For risk factors 
of morbidity, number of removed lymph node states and hypertension were 
independently significant for both early and late complications (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The type of urinary diversion affected only late complication, 
however, results of the matching analysis showed no significant differences in 
early and late morbidities between neobladder and ileal conduit.

INTRODUCTION: Radical pelvic surgery requires continent or incontinent urinary 
diversion. There are many techniques, but the orthotopic neobladder is the most 
used. A continent catheterizable urinary reservoir is sometimes a good 
alternative when this derivation is not possible or not indicated. This paper 
has aimed to present our experience with the Indiana pouch continent urinary 
reservoir.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series is made up of 85 patients, 66 women and 19 men, 
with a mean age of 56 years (31-77 years). Variables analyzed were operating 
time, estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, hospital stay and peri-operatory 
complications.
RESULTS: The main indication in 49 cases was resolution of complications related 
to the treatment of cervical cancer. Average operation time was 110.5 minutes 
(range 80-130 minutes). Mean blood loss was 450 cc (100-1000 cc). Immediate 
postoperative complications, all of which were treated medically, occurred in 16 
patients (18.85%). One patient suffered anastomotic leakage. Hospital stay was 
19 days (range 5-60 days) and there was no mortality in the series. Late 
complications occurred in 26 patients (32%), these being ureteral anastomotic 
stenosis in 11 cases, cutaneous stoma stenosis in 9 cases and reservoir stones 
in 6 cases.
CONCLUSION: The Indiana continent catheterizable urinary reservoir is a valid 
option for the treatment of both urological and gynecological malignancies as 
well as for the management of pelvic morbidity related to the treatment of 
pelvic cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To report continence and urodynamic findings after radical cystectomy 
and urinary diversion with modified S-ileal neobladder between January 1993 and 
January 2013.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 181 patients were enrolled. Continence status, reservoir 
sensation, compliance, capacity and activity were assessed.
RESULTS: Daytime continence was reported by 88.0, 98.4 and 99.2%, while 
nighttime continence was reported by 70.2, 94.0 and 95.8% of our patients at 6 
months, 5 years and 20 years, respectively. Enterocystometric capacity and 
maximum reservoir pressure were 366 vs. 405 ml and 502 ml, and 29 vs. 18 and 11 
cm H2O, at 6 months, 5 years and 20 years, respectively. Median post-void 
residual urine volume was 32 ml at 6 months, 50 ml at 5 years and 120 ml at 20 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified S-ileal neobladder technique has a very good 
long-lasting functional outcome, with high day- and nighttime continence levels 
as well as high acceptability rates from our patients.

OBJECTIVES: To assess health-related quality of life, and the impact of 
night-time incontinence and chronic urinary retention on health-related quality 
of life in women with bladder cancer after radical cystectomy and orthotopic 
neobladder.
METHODS: The study included 74 women who underwent radical cystectomy and 
orthotopic neobladder, and completed 1 year of follow up. Health-related quality 
of life was evaluated using the questionnaires of the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy bladder cancer-specific form. 
Health-related quality of life was compared with an age-matched control group. 
The impact of night-time incontinence and chronic urinary retention on 
health-related quality of life was assessed.
RESULTS: The study group included 18 completely continent patients with 
spontaneous voiding, 29 with night-time incontinence and 27 with chronic urinary 
retention. The study group was statistically significantly lower in all domains 
of health-related quality of life than the control group. In all domains of the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life 
Questionnaire and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy bladder 
cancer-specific form, completely continent women were comparable with those with 
chronic urinary retention. Women with night-time incontinence had a 
significantly worse health-related quality of life than completely continent 
women, shown by the mean global health score (P = 0.038), social functioning 
score (P = 0.012), pain European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire score (P = 0.04), and functional well-being 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy bladder cancer-specific form (P = 0.049) 
score.
CONCLUSIONS: After radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder in women, 
health-related quality of life is lower than that of the normal population. 
Night-time incontinence has a negative impact on social life and most domains of 
health-related quality of life. Thus, night-time incontinence has a higher 
social impact than chronic urinary retention.

Bladder cancer is a common type of genitourinary cancer, and radical cystectomy 
with urinary diversion is considered to be the most effective local treatment 
for invasive bladder cancer. In order to assess the functional results and 
health-related quality of life (QOL) in bladder cancer patients with an 
orthotopic neobladder, and to provide a reasonable basis for the evaluation of 
urinary diversion in situ, we conducted a study on 96 neobladder patients. In 
December, 2011, questionnaires were mailed to 96 patients that had undergone 
urinary diversion surgery between January, 2007 and December, 2009. The 
questionnaire included the validated health-related QOL questionnaire and the 
MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). We compared the functional results 
between patients with an orthotopic neobladder and those with other types of 
urinary diversion at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Data from 82 patients 
(54 with orthotopic and 28 with non-orthotopic urinary diversion) were included 
in the analysis. The SF-36 patient scores following orthotopic urinary diversion 
were significantly higher than those following non-orthotopic urinary diversion. 
The majority of patients with orthotopic urinary diversion considered themselves 
as healthy and their scores of total health were higher compared to those of 
patients with non-orthotopic urinary diversion. However, there were no 
differences in the scores of physical functioning between patients with 
orthotopic and those with non-orthotopic urinary diversion. Our findings 
regarding health-related QOL and the frequency of complications in the 
orthotopic and the non-orthotopic urinary diversion groups were similar. 
However, the mental health of patients with orthotopic urinary diversion was 
more easily restored compared to that of patients with non-orthotopic urinary 
diversion, which reduced their overall recovery time.

Extracellular cues play critical roles in the establishment of the epigenome 
during development and may also contribute to epigenetic perturbations found in 
disease states. The direct role of the local tissue environment on the 
post-development human epigenome, however, remains unclear due to limitations in 
studies of human subjects. Here, we use an isogenic human ileal neobladder 
surgical model and compare global DNA methylation levels of intestinal 
epithelial cells pre- and post-neobladder construction using the Infinium 
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our study is the first to quantify the effect of 
environmental cues on the human epigenome and show that the local tissue 
environment directly modulates DNA methylation patterns in normal differentiated 
cells in vivo. In the neobladder, the intestinal epithelial cells lose their 
tissue-specific epigenetic landscape in a time-dependent manner following the 
tissue's exposure to a bladder environment. We find that de novo methylation of 
many intestine-specific enhancers occurs at the rate of 0.41% per month (P < 
0.01, Pearson = 0.71), while demethylation of primarily non-intestine-specific 
transcribed regions occurs at the rate of -0.37% per month (P < 0.01, Pearson = 
-0.57). The dynamic resetting of the DNA methylome in the neobladder not only 
implicates local environmental cues in the shaping and maintenance of the 
epigenome but also illustrates an unexpected cross-talk between the epigenome 
and the cellular environment.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the oncologic and functional results of 
seminal-sparing cystectomy (SSC) in patients with bladder cancer (BC) and to 
describe the evolution of our surgical technique over a 20-year period.
METHODS: From 1990 to 2009 we performed SSC in 88 patients with 
non-muscle-invasive BC and in 10 patients with muscle-invasive BC away from the 
bladder neck. Sixty-one of the 98 patients (1990-2002) underwent 
cystoadenomectomy with ileocapsuloplasty (ICP), consisting of the anastomosis 
between the Camey II ileal reservoir and the upper edge of the prostatic 
capsule. This technique was affected by a relevant percentage of anastomotic 
stricture (11%). From 2003 to 2009, we performed the endocapsular ileourethral 
anastomosis (EIUA) in 30 patients, on the basis of the direct anastomosis 
between the ileal reservoir and the urethral stump inside the prostatic apex. 
Seven patients were lost to follow-up.
RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 102 months, 81 patients (89%) were alive, and 
10 patients (11%) had died (8 of disease progression). Early and late 
complication rates were 25% and 24%, respectively. Complete daytime continence 
was obtained in 87 patients (95.6%), and nighttime continence was achieved in 34 
patients (37%). In the ICP group, stricture of the prostatic fossa affected 7 
patients (11%), whereas no neobladder-urethral anastomosis stricture was noticed 
in the EIUA group. Normal erectile function was preserved in 87 patients 
(95.6%).
CONCLUSION: SSC offers good oncologic and functional results in carefully 
selected patients. EIUA represents an evolution from ICP because EIUA reduces 
the risk of stenosis.

During the past three decades, the reconstructive aspects of urologic surgery 
emerged and became a major component of our surgical specialty, and the most 
relevant developments have been observed in the field of urinary diversions. 
Health-related quality of life and self esteem have been improved following 
orthotopic bladder substitutions, which are actually the preferred method for 
continent urinary diversion. Patients with neobladders have enhanced cosmesis 
and the potential for normal voiding function with no abdominal stoma. Patient's 
selection for orthotopic neobladder formation is mandatory as most of the 
surgical complications or consequences associated with a neobladder are 
correlated not only with surgical technique or management after surgery, but 
also with wrong patient's selection. The principles of intestinal 
detubularization and reconfiguration to obtain spherical reservoir are the basis 
of continent urinary diversions and ileum seems to be preferable over any other 
segment. Nowadays, ileal neobladder is a widely adopted solution after 
cystectomy with a neobladder rate of 9-19% for population-based data with an 
increase to 39.1-74% for high-volume centers. However, controversies still exist 
in this urological field about the best candidates for neobladder construction, 
the best type of neobladder to offer, whether or not an antireflux uretero 
intestinal anastomosis should be used, the future of minimally invasive 
approaches, that is, robotic assisted cystectomy plus extracorporeal or 
intracorporeal neobladder, and last but very important, the functional results 
and the level of symptoms-induced distress and quality of life in the long term 
in patients with bladder cancer receiving an orthotopic bladder substitution. 
All these issues are discussed on the basis of the most recent published data.

BACKGROUND: Overall survival (OS) after radical cystectomy is determined. It is 
investigated retrospectively whether prediction is possible using a nomogram. A 
comparison with published data from "high-volume" centers is performed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 100 consecutive radical cystectomies performed 
between 2006 and 2012 were collected. Age, ASA score, tumor stage, urinary 
diversion, and Clavien score were recorded. The OS after 2 and 5 years was 
recorded (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and the nomogram-based predictive accuracy was 
calculated.
RESULTS: Median age was 70.8 years. A T≤2, T3, T4, N+ stage was present in 40, 
37, 23, and 43%, respectively. Urinary diversion: neobladder, conduit, and 
ureterostomy were performed in 35, 53, and 12%. The 30-day mortality was 1%. At 
follow-up, there were 95 patients with a median observation time of 19.8 months. 
The 2- and 5-year OS were 0.68 and 0.45 (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and 0.65 and 
0.39, respectively (nomogram). A significant correlation was observed (rs=0.79; 
rs=0.80). Compared to published "high-volume" series, no relevant differences 
concerning morbidity, mortality, and OS were observed. However, there are 
significant differences concerning the characteristics of "high-volume centers".
CONCLUSION: In this series, the OS can be predicted by a multivariate nomogram. 
The results are comparable with published data. There is no clear definition of 
a "high-volume center".

BACKGROUND: We analyzed long-term changes in the renal function of patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion (UD).
METHODS: This study included 169 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and 
UD (42, cutaneous ureterostomy; 40, ileal conduit; 87, neobladder substitution), 
and were followed for at least 60 months (median 106 months). Renal 
deterioration was defined as a >25 % decrease in the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) relative to that prior to surgery. We determined the 
associations between several parameters and postoperative renal deterioration.
RESULTS: Despite the significantly younger age and more favorable renal function 
of patients with neobladder substitution than of those with other types of UD, 
no significant differences were observed in the remaining preoperative clinical 
parameters among the three different UD groups. The mean eGFR of the 169 
patients decreased from 69.6 to 55.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and renal deterioration 
was observed in 24 (57.1 %), 20 (50.0 %) and 34 (39.0 %) patients in the 
cutaneous ureterostomy, ileal conduit and neobladder substitution groups, 
respectively. Multivariate analysis of several parameters identified the 
presence of baseline hypertension and an episode of acute pyelonephritis, but 
not the type of UD, as significant predictors of postoperative renal 
deterioration.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of renal deterioration was comparatively high 
following radical cystectomy, irrespective of the type of UD. Special attention 
should be paid to the long-term preservation of renal function in these 
patients, particularly those with hypertension and/or episodes of acute 
pyelonephritis.

INTRODUCTION: Some cases of secondary adenocarcinoma developing in the replaced 
bowel segment of urinary diversions have been reported so far. Secondary 
adenocarcinoma develops 20 years after surgery in about 0.5% of those in whom an 
ileal segment is used. There have been several reports in the literature 
describing extensions of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) from the distal 
urether into an ileal conduit. Histology of loop tumor in 50% was TCC. The site 
of tumors in the majority of cases is the area at the uretheral orifices or the 
stoma.
CASE REPORT: We presented a rare case of transitional cell carcinoma in an 
orthotopic ileal neobladder 12 years after radical cystoprostatectomy and ileal 
neobladder with the substitution by the procedure Camey II. A 65-year-old man 
with high-grade urothelial carcinoma of neobladder underwent partial resection 
of neobladder and right nephroureterectomy. Pathological analysis revealed 
high-grade urothelial carcinoma to the ileal neobladder (G II, Stage T2b). The 
patient died of laryngeal cancer a year after the surgery.
CONCLUSION: Surgery of tumors in orthotopic neobladders is possible if diagnosed 
in time. In the presented case surgery resulted only in a decrease in the 
capacity of the neobladder without having an effect on the continence itself.

PURPOSE: We determined the oncologic and urological outcomes in patients with 
bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma according to the type and timing of urinary 
tract surgery, with emphasis on the role of the Padua orthotopic ileal 
neobladder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed oncologic and urological 
outcomes of 11 consecutive patients treated at our institution between 1998 and 
2012.
RESULTS: Two patients underwent urethrectomy and placement of a heterotopic 
catheterizable ileal neobladder. The membranous urethra was preserved in 
9 patients, 6 underwent primary Padua ileal neobladder at radical cystectomy, 
2 underwent delayed Padua ileal neobladder and 1 underwent bilateral cutaneous 
ureterostomy. Four of these 9 patients experienced disease recurrence, including 
local recurrence in 2 despite negative intraoperative biopsies. Survivors 
undergoing heterotopic catheterizable ileal neobladder or primary Padua ileal 
neobladder learned to empty the bladder to completion without long-term upper 
tract deterioration. Both cases managed by delayed Padua ileal neobladder 
required clean intermittent catheterization eventually. Erections were reported 
in 5 of 6 surviving males.
CONCLUSIONS: The Padua ileal neobladder allowed preservation of volitional 
urethral voiding in all survivors in whom it was placed at radical cystectomy. 
Nevertheless, local recurrence was noted in 2 of the 9 cases where the 
membranous urethra was preserved. By comparison, patients undergoing delayed 
Padua ileal neobladder after attaining disease-free status never achieved 
voiding per urethra. Therefore, a heterotopic reservoir might be a more reliable 
choice under these circumstances. Erectile function is preserved in the majority 
of cases.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) among long-term disease-free survivors in women who underwent 
radical cystectomy (RC) for urothelial carcinoma and orthotopic ileal neobladder 
(ONB) reconstruction, using validated patient-reported outcome instruments.
METHODS: From 2000 to 2011, a total of 46 women with urothelial bladder 
carcinoma had RC and ONB at our institution; 31 (67 %) eligible women completed 
3 validated questionnaires: the medical outcome study short form 12 (SF-12), the 
urinary symptom profile, and the Contilife, respectively evaluating general 
HRQoL, voiding function, and urinary incontinence specific HRQoL. Unadjusted 
analyses were performed to analyze standardized measures of HRQoL and voiding 
symptoms; p < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 5.7 years; 24 women (77 %) considered their 
health as good, very good, or excellent. The SF-12 physical and mental scores 
were not significantly different between the population study and the general 
population (p > 0.05). A total of 20 women (65 %) declared to be fully 
continent. Daytime incontinence, nighttime incontinence, and hypercontinence 
were reported by 26, 29, and 31 % of women, respectively. On unadjusted 
analysis, incontinence was associated with age > 65 years at the time of surgery 
(p < 0.001). Hypercontinence was not associated with any variable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in the setting of radical cystectomy in 
women, ileal neobladder reconstruction provides long-term satisfaction with 
maintained HRQoL. For properly selected women, orthotopic neobladder can be 
considered an appropriate diversion choice.

OBJECTIVES: Functional and urodynamic (UDS) outcomes of W-configured ileal 
orthotopic neobladder (ONB) with extramural serosa-lined tunnel uretero-ileal 
anastomosis are presented
METHODS: Consecutive 17 patients undergoing ONB during December 2009 to March 
2011 were enrolled. Of these 15 men (bladder cancer 14, tuberculosis 1) with 
mean age 52.7 ± 11.3 years completed the follow-up. Pouch-related quality of 
life (PQOL) was assessed using a published questionnaire. Uroflowmetry, 
cystometry/cystography and urethral-pressure profilometry were done at two 
follow-up visits at least 3 months apart. Mean follow up 10 ± 5 months. Mean 
length of harvested ileum 48 ± 6 cm.
RESULTS: Overall PQOL were similar at both evaluations (55 ± 11 and 54 ± 15, 
respectively). During first and second follow-up, maximum flow-rate, 
voided-volume and post-void residual urine were 11 ± 4 mL/sec, 246 ± 99 mL and 
68 ± 74.9 mL and 10.4 ± 4.6 mL/sec, 234 ± 138 mL and 86 ± 146 mL, respectively. 
Mean neobladder capacity, compliance, maximum urethral closure-pressure (MUCP) 
and functional urethral length were 484 ± 244 mL, 50.5 ± 49.1 mL/cmH2 O, 
42 ±20 cmH2 O and 22 ± 12 mm, and 468 ± 250 mL, 46.4 ± 47.5 mL/cmH2 O, 
52 ± 27cmH2 O and 23 ± 12 mm, respectively. Patients with smaller pouch 
(r = 0.828; P = 0.0001), longer urethral length (r = -0.392; P = 0.023) and 
lesser incontinence (r = 0.429; P = 0.011) had significantly better PQOL. With 
continued supervised pelvic-floor rehabilitation, a trend in improvement in 
hesitancy (P = 0.058), MUCP (P = 0.05) and bothersome incontinence (P = NS) was 
observed. None of the patients had any obstruction or reflux of the upper 
tracts.
CONCLUSION: The index ONB has reasonable storage and voiding characteristics but 
with a rider of nocturnal urinary incontinence.

Orthotopic urinary diversion after radical cystectomy in treatment of muscle 
invasive bladder cancer.

Jovan HD, Vladan A, Tomislav P, Miodrag A, Uroš B, Miodrag S, Zoran D.

Surgical treatment of invasive carcinoma of the bladder in males includes total 
cystectomy removal of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and the distal parts of 
the urethers and the pelvic lymph node dissection as well. At this moment it is 
not possible to recommend a particular type of urinary diversion, but today in 
clinical practice commonly used derivative are ileal orthotopic neobladder as 
the continent one and ileal conduit as non-continent urinary diversion. 
Continent urinary diversion after radical cystectomy are the result of the 
application of technological innovation in surgery, but also knowledge, 
imagination and skill of well trained urologist. This type of operation 
significantly improves the quality of life in patients who underwent radical 
cystectomy, and the proposal is to operate whenever there is a possibility for 
this type of procedure. Also it is very important, during surgery to respect 
oncological principles, of complete removal of tumorous tissue and that the 
functional principle of ensur- ing that the patients have daytime and also 
nighttime continence later on after the surgery.

extraperitonealization of orthotopic neobladder for invasive high-grade bladder 
cancer: a preliminary analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a technique for radical cystectomy with 
extraperitonealization of orthotopic neobladder (RCEN) that reduces 
bowel-related complications by preservation of the peritoneum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with non-metastatic bladder cancer 
underwent RCEN by a peritoneum preserving technique. The study included 13 
patients with T1 high-grade bladder cancer and 2 with T2a bladder cancer. To 
compare perioperative outcomes including bowel-related complications, we also 
reviewed 15 patients who underwent traditional cystectomy with ileal Studer 
neobladder who were matched for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, tumor stage, tumor grade, tumor size, and 
location. Female genital organs were preserved in five female patients who 
underwent the RCEN technique.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two cohorts (RECN vs. 
traditional technique) with respect to age, body mass index, ASA score, or tumor 
characteristics. The mean operative time was similar between the two groups. The 
patients who underwent RECN exhibited earlier recovery of normal gas pattern on 
plain abdominal X-ray during the postoperative period and an earlier resumption 
of normal diet. The mean hospital stay was shorter in the RECN group than the 
traditional group.
CONCLUSIONS: The RECN technique preserving the whole peritoneum is a feasible 
approach that significantly reduces bowel-related complications in selected 
patients.

CONTEXT: The urinary reconstructive options available after radical cystectomy 
(RC) for bladder cancer are discussed, as are the criteria for selection of the 
most appropriate diversion, and the outcomes and complications associated with 
different diversion options.
OBJECTIVE: To critically review the peer-reviewed literature on the function and 
oncological outcomes, complications, and factors influencing choice of procedure 
with urinary diversion after RC for bladder carcinoma.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search was conducted to identify original 
articles, review articles, and editorials on urinary diversion in patients 
treated with RC. Searches were limited to the English language. Keywords 
included: 'bladder cancer', 'cystectomy', 'diversion', 'neobladder', and 
'conduit'. The articles with the highest level of evidence were selected and 
reviewed, with the consensus of all of the authors of this paper.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Both continent and incontinent diversions are available for 
urinary reconstruction after RC. In appropriately selected patients, an 
orthotopic neobladder permits the elimination of an external stoma and 
preservation of body image without compromising cancer control. However, the 
patient must be fully educated and committed to the labour-intensive 
rehabilitation process. He must also be able to perform self-catheterisation if 
necessary. When involvement of the urinary outflow tract by tumour prevents the 
use of an orthotopic neobladder, a continent cutaneous reservoir may still offer 
the opportunity for continence albeit one that requires obligate 
self-catheterisation. For patients who are not candidates for continent 
diversion, the ileal loop remains an acceptable and reliable option.
CONCLUSIONS: Both continent and incontinent diversions are available for urinary 
reconstruction after RC. Orthotopic neobladders optimally preserve body image, 
while continent cutaneous diversions represent a reasonable alternative. Ileal 
conduits represent the fastest, easiest, least complication-prone, and most 
commonly performed urinary diversion.

georg.bartsch@kgu.de.

PURPOSE: The ratio between orthotopic and non-orthotopic diversions in women is 
far lower than in male patients. Data on urinary function in female patients 
with neobladders are therefore sparse.
METHODS: We investigated the urinary function of female neobladder patients 
utilizing the Bladder Cancer Index, a validated and reliable health-related 
quality-of-life (HRQOL) questionnaire. Furthermore, we tried to identify 
preoperative factors that may influence functional results. All living female 
patients with an orthotopic neobladder (N = 82) from the University of Southern 
California Bladder Cancer Database were sent a questionnaire including the 
University of Michigan Bladder Cancer Index. Univariate analyses were performed 
using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a multivariate stepwise regression 
model.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (68.3%) responded and were included in the analysis. 
Thirty-five (62.5%) of these patients had to catheterize their neobladder to a 
certain amount, while 25 patients (44.6%) depend on catheterization to empty 
their neobladder. Univariate analyses showed that patient age (>65 years) was 
the only variable associated with a statistically significant lower rate of 
neobladder catheterization. Better urinary bother scores were associated with 
organ-confined disease (p = 0.038) and education level (p = 0.01). However, 
these variables were not significant in a multivariate stepwise linear 
regression model.
CONCLUSION: Considerably more women require urinary catheterization to void than 
previously reported. In this study, representing the largest investigated cohort 
in this topic, we were unable to identify any predictors of this outcome or any 
other urinary HRQOL in this cohort.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the differences in the type, incidence, and severity of 
90-day morbidity after radical cystectomy between two different methods of 
urinary diversion, ileal conduit and neobladder.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective multi-institutional study by reviewing 
the records of 668 patients treated with open radical cystectomy, and ileal 
conduit (n = 493) or neobladder substitution (n = 175) between 1997 and 2010. 
All complications within 90 days after surgery were divided into 11 specific 
categories as reported by the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and graded 
according to the modified Clavien system. Type, incidence and severity of the 
90-day morbidity between the two different types of urinary diversions were 
compared.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall complication rates 
between the two groups (ileal conduit: 72% [353/493], neobladder: 74% [129/175], 
P = 0.5909), whereas the neobladder group had fewer major (grade 3 or more) 
complications (13 vs 20%, respectively, P = 0.0271). The neobladder group had 
more infectious complications (43 vs 31%, respectively, P = 0.0037), mainly as a 
result of urinary tract infection, whereas the ileal conduit group had more 
wound-related complications (24 vs 14%, respectively, P = 0.0068), mainly as a 
result of surgical site infection. The 90-day mortality rates were 1.1% (2/175) 
in the neobladder group and 1.6% (8/493) in the ileal conduit group (P = 
0.6441).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the overall complication 
rates between the two methods, and patients with neobladder had fewer major 
complications. The neobladder group had more infectious complications, whereas 
the ileal conduit group had more wound-related complications.

OBJECTIVE: To report oncologic outcomes and complications after robotic-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2004 to August 2011, 175 consecutive patients 
underwent RARC with extracorporeal urinary diversion at our institution by a 
single surgeon. The study design was prospective. Perioperative parameters and 
postoperative complications were prospectively collected using the modified 
Clavien system. Recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival curves 
were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 145 men and 30 women with a median age of 73 years and a 
median body mass index of 27 kg/m(2) underwent RARC. Four patients (2.3%) 
required conversion to open surgery because of difficulty to progress. One 
hundred nine patients (62%) underwent a transcutaneous ileal conduit, 40 
patients (23%) an orthotopic neobladder, and 26 (15%) a continent cutaneous 
conduit. The median operating time was 360 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 
300-420). The median estimated blood loss was 400 mL (IQR: 250-612), with a 
transfusion rate of 17.0%. The median postoperative length of stay was 7.0 days 
(IQR: 5.2-10). Early (<30 days) and late surgery-related complications (30-90 
days) occurred in 74 (42%) and 59 (34%) patients, respectively. The 
perioperative mortality rate was 2.8%. The positive soft tissue surgical margins 
rate was 5%. The median number of lymph nodes removed was 19 (IQR: 12-28). The 
median follow-up was 37 months (IQR: 21.5-53.5). Actuarial recurrence-free 
survival and cancer-specific survival at 2, 3, and 5 years after RARC were 67%, 
63%, 63% and 73%, 68%, 66%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RARC achieved mid-term oncologic efficacy. Moreover, the 
complication rates were comparable with open radical cystectomy series.

INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is an emerging 
minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. The 
V-loc (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) suture is a unidirectional barbed suture that 
provides even distribution of tension. We determined the rate of urinary leak at 
the urethro-intestinal anastomosis following orthotopic neobladder construction 
performed with V-loc suture.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed charts on all patients that underwent RARC 
with orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion performed with a V-loc suture from 
February 2010 to February 2012. The urethro-intestinal anastomosis was evaluated 
for urinary leak by cystogram at 3 to 4 weeks, postoperatively.
RESULTS: In total, 11 patients were available for analysis. The mean patient age 
was 57.2 years (range: 47-71). The average clinical follow-up was 8 months 
(range: 4-15). On surgical pathology, 8 (73%) patients had pT2 or less disease, 
3 (27%) had pT3/T4 disease, and 1 (9%) had N+ disease. The mean intraoperative 
blood loss was 315 mL (range: 150-600) and the average operative time was 496 
minutes (range: 485-519). No patient (0%) demonstrated a urinary leak at the 
urethro-intestinal anastomosis on postoperative cystogram. Eight patients (73%) 
were continent by 4 months, postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Orthotopic neobladder urethro-intestinal anastomosis can be 
performed effectively and safely with V-loc suture with an acceptably low 
urinary leak rate.

[Urinary re-diversion using afferent limb as an ileal conduit for urethral 
recurrence after ileal neobladder reconstruction by Studer method : a case

A 68-year-old man who had previously undergone radical cystectomy and ileal 
neobladder reconstruction by the Studer method for invasive bladder cancer one 
year ago was urgently admitted to our hospital with gross hematuria and severe 
anemia. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed 
an expanded ileal neobladder with a huge coagulum and tumor. Cystoscopy showed a 
non-papillary tumor occurring from the urethral anastomotic region toward the 
ileal neobladder and suggested the possibility of partial invasion to the ileal 
neobladder wall. The pathologic diagnosis of transurethral resection was 
invasive urothelial carcinoma, high grade, G3. We performed resection of ileal 
neobladder and urinary re-diversion using an afferent limb as ileal conduit. 
Unfortunately, in this case, a radical cure was not provided, but we considered 
that urinary re-diversion using an afferent limb as ileal conduit can be a 
useful option for urethral recurrence after ileal neobladder reconstruction.

OBJECTIVE: Orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion is associated with a high 
rate of infectious complications, especially in the early postoperative period. 
The aim of the study was to assess the incidence, associated pathogens, and 
predictors of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with an 
orthotopic neobladder.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The medical records of 79 patients treated with radical 
cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion at a tertiary medical 
center in 2004 to 2012 were reviewed for data pertaining to bacteriuria and 
symptomatic UTI after hospital discharge. Cumulative incidences of clinical 
events were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression models were used to identify clinical predictors of infection.
RESULTS: A total of 69 men and 10 women were included in the study cohort. The 
estimated cumulative rates of symptomatic UTI were 34% at 3 months, 40% at 6 
months, and 43% at 12 months. New events of symptomatic UTI occurred in 36% of 
the patients during the first 3 postoperative months, but only in 10% at 3 to 6 
months and 8% at 6 to 12 months. Common pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
(24%) and Escherichia coli (24%); 78% of bacterial pathogens were susceptible to 
amikacin. On multivariate analysis, there was no effect of age, gender, 
intermittent catheterization, bowel segment used for reconstruction, or 
perioperative chemotherapy on rates of UTI.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic UTI is a common complication after neobladder 
reconstruction, usually occurring within the first 3 months of surgery. P. 
aeruginosa infection is common. Inpatient empirical treatment with amikacin is 
recommended in this setting.

PURPOSE: We determined whether laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) was useful 
for the patients with bladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the surgical outcome of LRC in the 
initial 30 patients with bladder cancer.
RESULTS: Mean patients age was 68 (54-81) years old. Twenty six male and 4 
female were enrolled. Lymphnode dissection was variably performed under 
aeroperitoneum. Twenty six patients were undergone ileal conduit and 4 patients 
were undergone ileal neobladder as urinary diversion. The urinary diversion of 
all cases was undergone extra-corporeally. Seventeen patients were received 
platinum based neo and adjivant-chemotherapy. Mean surgical time was 684 
(398-950) min, and mean aeroperitoneum time was 418 (235-660) min. 
Intraoperative major complications were ureter injury and blood loss. Mean blood 
loss was 1,063 (150-2,730) ml intraoperatively. Ileus and acute pyeronephritis 
were observed in the 3 patients postoperatively. Seven patients relapsed and 2 
patients died with bladder cancer in 14.9 months of median follow-up period 
(0.7-35.9) after the surgery. Progression free survival rate and overall 
survival rate at a year after surgery were 75.2% and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical therapy with LRC was well tolerated and successful in 
the patients with bladder cancer.

BACKGROUND: Intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) has the potential benefits 
of a smaller incision, reduced pain, decreased bowel exposure, and reduced risk 
of fluid imbalance.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing 
extracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD) and ICUD following robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed the database of the International 
Robotic Cystectomy Consortium (IRCC) (18 international centers), with 935 
patients who had undergone RARC and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) between 
2003 and 2011.
INTERVENTION: All patients within the IRCC underwent RARC and PLND as indicated. 
The urinary diversion was performed either intracorporeally or extracorporeally.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Demographic data, perioperative 
outcomes, and complications in patients undergoing ICUD or ECUD were compared. 
All patients had at least a 90-d follow-up. The Fisher exact test was used to 
summarize categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test or Kruskal-Wallis 
test for continuous variables.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 935 patients who had RARC and PLND, 167 patients 
underwent ICUD (ileal conduit: 106; neobladder: 61), and 768 patients had an 
ECUD (ileal conduit: 570; neobladder: 198). Postoperative complications data 
were available for 817 patients, with a minimum follow-up of 90 d. There was no 
difference in age, gender, body mass index, American Society of 
Anesthesiologists grade, or rate of prior abdominal surgery between the groups. 
The operative time was equivalent (414 min), with the median hospital stay being 
marginally longer for the ICUD group (9 d vs 8 d, p=0.086). No difference in the 
reoperation rates at 30 d was noted between the groups. The 90-d complication 
rate was not significant between the two groups, but a trend favoring ICUD over 
ECUD was noted (41% vs 49%, p=0.05). Gastrointestinal complications were 
significantly lower in the ICUD group (p ≤ 0.001). Patients with ICUD were at a 
lower risk of experiencing a postoperative complication at 90 d (32%) (odds 
ratio: 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.94; p=0.02). Being a retrospective 
study was the main limitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted ICUD can be accomplished safely, with comparable 
outcomes to open urinary diversion. In this cohort, patients undergoing ICUD had 
a relatively lower risk of complications.

We describe a simple modification in Hautmann neobladder that involves an 
elongation of its left chimney to advance it through the pelvic mesocolon in 
order to reach the left ureter in its original place. This technique was carried 
out on 27 patients who had Hautmann pouch after radical cystectomy, and we 
reported the outcome and complications that occurred at the site of 
urteteroileal anastomosis in the first 3 years after surgery. The modification 
was applied easily without any perioperative complications that were related to 
this step in particular. During follow up of these cases, we lost three patients 
who died before the end of the third postoperative year. At a mean follow up of 
41.3 ± 10.2 months, we have not detected any cases of stricture formation or 
ureteral recurrence at the sites of the ureteroileal anastmosis. There was only 
one patient who developed acute pyelonephritis (3.7%) as a result of reflux.

The present study aimed to report the urodynamic data from 46 male patients who 
underwent an orthotopic N-shaped neobladder replacement following a radical 
cystectomy during a 12-month period and to provide urodynamic evidence for the 
improvement of this technique. A total of 46 consecutive male patients underwent 
a radical cystectomy and orthotopic N-shaped neobladder substitution due to 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Uroflowmetry, cystometry and urethral pressure 
profilometry were analyzed at 3-12 months following the surgery. The mean 
pressure of the neobladders was <15 cm H2O at volumes of <400 ml and 22.4 cm H2O 
at 100% capacity at 6 months. The mean pressure of the contractions was <40 cm 
H2O at 6 months. The mean filling pressure following the surgery at 3 months was 
higher compared with that at 6 months. No difference was observed at the other 
time-points. When comparing the 9- and 12-month urodynamic characteristics, no 
significant changes were observed in the cystometric capacity. The mean 
post-void residual (PVR) urine volume was 58 ml. A mean voiding peak of 16.2 
ml/sec was obtained using the Valsalva maneuver. The daytime continence rate was 
90% at 12 months while the night-time continence rate was 60%.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize anesthesia management of laparoscopic radical cystectomy 
and orthotopic bladder surgery with a robotic surgical system.
METHODS: In the study of 10 cases of bladder cancer, the robot-assisted radical 
cystectomy+expand lymphadenectomy+orthotopic bladder surgery with 60 degrees of 
Trendelenburg surgical position, was inserted into the manipulator under the 
video system monitor positioning, to complete the removal of the diseased tissue 
dissection and orthotopic ileal neobladder intra-abdominal. The respiratory 
parameters, hemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gas analysis were monitored 
and the waking time, intake and output, and intraoperative concurrent recorded.
RESULTS: All the patients were operated successfully. The intraoperative blood 
loss was (342.9 ± 303.4) mL; the peak airway pressure increased after 
trendelenburg and high pneumoperitoneum; the mean arterial pressure heart rate 
and central venous pressure increased compared with the endotracheal intubation 
15 minutes after two cases of the disease popularity abdominal end-expiratory 
CO2 partial pressure more than 50 mmHg, and PaCO2 higher than 60 mmHg in the 
arterial blood gas. When the respiratory parameters were adjusted, the 
hyperventilation showed no improvement, and when the pressure was reduced to 
less than 15 mmHg, the pneumoperitoneum improved; when metabolic acidosis 
occured in 2 patients, sodium bicarbonate post-correction was given; during 
surgery, 2 patients potassium rose to more than 5.5 mmol/L, gluconate and 
insulin were given; 5 patients developed multiple subcutaneous emphysema, of 
whom 1 was confined to the chest and abdomen, and 1 showed significant sense of 
gripping the snow from face to feet, associated with hypercapnia and temperature 
drop; the wake time (withdrawal to the extubation time) was (94.2 ± 35.6) min.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy + orthotopic bladder surgery is a 
newly-performed clinical surgery. Because of the huge machines, long time 
pneumoperitoneum and over-head-down, it is prone to acid-base balance and ion 
imbalance, thus increasing the difficulty and complexity to anesthesia 
management. It's necessary to further summarize the impact on the respiratory, 
hemodynamic, and nervous system.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effects of the direct refluxing-type 
ureteroileal anastomosis technique with those of an antireflux technique on 
individual renal units, using diuretic scintigraphy in a prospectively 
randomized study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2006, a prospective randomized study was 
conducted on 102 patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. 
In every patient, both ureters were randomized to be implanted using a direct 
refluxing technique or an antireflux, serous-lined extramural tunnel (SLET) 
technique. Renal function (RF) was evaluated using (99m)Tc-MAG-3 diuretic 
scintigraphy. The serial changes in corrected glomerular filtration rate (cGFR) 
for each technique and for each side were compared.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 6 years, the patients in both the direct 
refluxing and the SLET technique groups were found to have a significant 
reduction in mean (SD) cGFR between baseline and last follow-up: cGFR decreased 
from 59.4 (12.4) to 45.6 (15.3) mL/min (P < 0.001) and from 54.3 (11.2) to 46.3 
(12.8) mL/min (P = 0.002), respectively. Five patients (4.9%) in the SLET group 
developed obstruction (four left-sided and one right-sided) compared with one 
(0.9%) in the direct refluxing group (right-sided). The onset of obstruction was 
noted 1-7 months after radical cystectomy. There was no significant difference 
between the groups in reductions in cGFR across the timepoints. Comparison of 
the two techniques according to the side of ureter implantation showed that the 
direct refluxing technique trended towards better functional outcomes on the 
left side.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no observed difference in the RF of individual renal 
units between the SLET and the direct refluxing groups in the long term. The 
need to incorporate an antireflux technique should be questioned and tailored 
according to the surgeon's experience and confidence.

florian.jentzmik@uniklinik-ulm.de.

The incidence of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is increasing. Many 
different and multimodal novel treatment options were brought on the way since 
the beginning of a new era in the early 1980s, when the neobladder as a common 
option for urinary diversion had been induced. In addition to open radical 
cystectomy and urinary diversion, recently, minimal invasive surgery has been 
implemented in experienced centers and led to promising results in short term 
follow-up, awaiting confirmation in larger cohorts. Pelvic lymphnode dissection 
can cure patients with low metastatic load. Expansion of pelvic lymphonodal 
dissection and its influence on survival was discussed intensively with trends 
to a moderate enlargement of the standard field. Outcome in nodal positive 
disease is remaining poor, while 90% of patients with multiple lymphnode 
metastases will suffer from systemic progress 5 years after diagnosis. In the 
last decade, treatment regimens based on neoajuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy 
were published with different results on efficiency. To decide whether to treat 
with surgery alone, or to offer perioperative systemic cytostatic therapy, is 
one of the unanswered questions. Furthermore, bladder preserving techniques are 
still optional for patients with small unifocal lesions or the medically unfit 
cohort. This review summarizes current data and aims to help guiding through 
several available recommendations on therapy and management of MIBC.

Radical cystectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution: surgical tricks and 
management of complications.

Izquierdo L(1), Bolton DM, Lawrentschuk N.

Author information:

lawrentschuk@gmail.com.

AIM: Bladder cancer is the second most common urological malignancy, with 
urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) comprising almost 90% of all 
primary bladder tumours. Over recent decades, radical cystectomy has emerged as 
the predominant treatment modality for patients with high-grade, invasive 
urothelial cancers and for those with less-invasive disease who fail treatment 
with bladder-preservation strategies. Bladder substitution following radical 
cystectomy has become increasingly common and in many centers has evolved to 
become the standard method of urinary diversion. The main goal of this paper is 
to review intraoperative considerations for patients undergoing radical 
cystectomy with a focus on issues specific to surgical tricks with neobladder 
construction and postoperative complications.
METHODS: Systematic literature review in Pubmed and Embase including bladder 
cancer, urinary diversion, neobladder, surgical technique and complications as 
key words.
RESULTS: Intraoperative techniques and modifications have made neobladder 
construction more amenable and the standard in suitable patients. Postoperative 
complications still occur in a significant number of patients but may be 
minimised and recognised early for better outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Orthotopic bladder substitution does not compromise oncological 
outcome and importantly can be performed with relatively good results regarding 
functional and quality of life issues. Modifications to intraoperative technique 
can assist with neobladder construction to aid better outcomes. Where possible 
orthotopic bladder substitution should be the diversion of choice. Of paramount 
importance is the active postoperative management and regular long-term 
follow-up of patients with an orthotopic bladder substitution.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the erectile function (EF) and sexual desire (SD) in men 
after radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) who had either an ileal conduit urinary 
diversion or orthotropic ileal neobladder substitution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty one sexually active men with bladder cancer were 
enrolled in this prospective study. After RCP according to patients' preferences 
they underwent either ileal conduit urinary diversion (n = 41) or orthotropic 
ileal neobladder substitution (n = 40). EF and SD were assessed using 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Patients were 
assessed at 4-week before surgery and were followed up at 1, 6, and 12-month 
postoperatively using the same questionnaire.
RESULTS: Postoperatively the EF and SD domains deteriorated significantly in 
both groups, but in a small proportion of the patients submitted to ileal 
neobladder they gradually improved with time (P = 0.006). At 12-month 
postoperative period, 4 (9.8 %) and 14 (35.0 %) patients in ileal conduit and 
ileal neobladder groups were able to achieve erections hard enough for vaginal 
penetration and maintained their erection to completion of intercourse, 
respectively (P = 0.006). Among patients in the ileal conduit and ileal 
neobladder groups, additional 4 (9.8 %) and 7 (17.1 %) patients were able to get 
some erection, but were unable to maintain their erection to completion of 
intercourse (P = 0.02). At 12-month follow up period 24.4 % of the ileal conduit 
and 45.0 % of the ileal neobladder patients rated their sexual desire very high 
or high (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: When performed properly, orthotopic ileal neobladder substitution 
after RCP offers better long-term results in terms of EF and SD.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the learning curve on operative, 
postoperative, and pathological outcomes of the first 67 totally intracorporeal 
robot-assisted radical cystectomies (RARCs) with neobladders performed by two 
lead surgeons at Karolinska University Hospital.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2003 and October 2012, 67 patients (61 
men and six women) underwent RARC with orthotopic urinary diversion by two main 
surgeons. Data were collected prospectively on patient demographics, peri- and 
postoperative outcomes including operation times, conversion rates, blood loss, 
complication rates, pathological data and length of stay (LOS) for these 67 
consecutive patients. The two surgeons operated on 47 and 20 patients, 
respectively. The patients were divided into sequential groups of 10 in each 
individual surgeon's series and assessed for effect of the learning curve.
RESULTS: Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were similar in both 
surgeons' groups. The overall total operation times trended down in both 
surgeons' series from a median time of 565 min in the first group of 10 cases, 
to a median of 345 min in the last group for surgeon A (P < 0.001) and 413 to 
385 min for surgeon B (not statistically significant). Risk of conversion to 
open surgery also decreased with a 30% conversion rate in the first group to 
zero in latter groups (P < 0.01). Overall complications decreased as the 
learning curve progressed from 70% in the first group to 30% in the later groups 
(P < 0.05), although major complications were not statistically different when 
compared between the groups. Patient demographics did not change over time. The 
mean estimated blood loss was unchanged across groups with increasing 
experience. The pathological staging, mean total lymph node yield and number of 
positive margins were also unchanged across groups. There was a decrease in LOS 
from a mean of 19 days in the first group to a mean (range) of 9 (4-78) days in 
the later groups, although the median LOS was unchanged and therefore not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Totally intracorporeal RARC with intracorporeal neobladder is a 
complex procedure, but it can be performed safely, with a structured approach, 
at a high-volume established robotic surgery centre without compromising 
perioperative and pathological outcomes during the learning curve for surgeons. 
An experienced robotic team and mentor can impact the learning curve of a new 
surgeon in the same centre resulting in decreased operation times early in their 
personal series, reducing conversion rates and complication rates.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a prospective comparison of quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes 
in patients who underwent ileal conduit (IC) urinary diversion with those who 
underwent orthotopic neobladder (ONB) reconstruction after radical cystectomy 
for invasive bladder cancers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2007 and December 2012, 227 patients 
underwent radical cystectomy and either IC urinary diversion or ONB (sigmoid or 
ileal) reconstruction. Contraindications for ON were impaired renal function 
(serum creatinine >2 mg/dL), chronic inflammatory bowel disease, previous bowel 
resection and tumour involvement at the bladder neck/prostatic urethra. Patients 
who did not have these contraindications chose to undergo either IC or ONB 
reconstruction, after impartial counselling. Baseline characteristics, including 
demographic profile, body mass index, comorbidities, histopathology of the 
cystoprostatectomy (with lymph nodes) specimen, pathological tumour stage, 
postoperative complications, adjuvant therapy and relapse, were recorded and 
compared. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL 
questionnaire C30 version 3 was used to analyse QoL before surgery and 6, 12 and 
18 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Of the 227 patients, 28 patients in the IC group and 35 in the ONB 
group were excluded. The final analysis included 80 patients in the IC and 84 in 
the ONB group. None of the baseline characteristics were significantly different 
between the groups, except for age, but none of the baseline QoL variables were 
found to be correlated with age. In the preoperative phase, there were no 
significant differences in any of the QoL domains between the IC or the ONB 
groups. At 6, 12 and 18 months in the postoperative period, physical functioning 
(P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), role functioning (P = 0.01, 
P = 0.01 and P = 0.003, respectively), social functioning (P = 0.01, P = 0.01 
and P = 0.01, respectively) and global health status/QoL (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 
and P = 0.002, respectively) were better in patients in the ONB group than in 
those in the IC group and the differences were significant. The financial burden 
related to bladder cancer treatment was significantly lower in the ONB group 
than in the IC group at 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up (P = 0.05, P = 0.05 and 
P = 0.005, respectively)
CONCLUSIONS: ONB is better than IC in terms of physical functioning, role 
functioning, social functioning, global health status/QoL and financial 
expenditure. ONB reconstruction provides better QoL outcomes than does IC 
urinary diversion.

OBJECTIVES: To reduce short-term complications of radical cystectomy (RC) and 
intestinal urinary diversion with vescica ileale Padovana (VIP) neobladder, we 
described and assessed an enhanced recovery protocol (ERP) in a series of 
consecutive patients.
METHODS: An ERP was introduced focusing on reduced bowel preparation, 
standardized feeding and analgesic regimens. We analyzed the outcomes with all 
patients consecutively undergoing RC and VIP neobladder who met the following 
inclusion criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists score <3; absence of 
malnutrition according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form criteria; 
absence of inflammatory bowel diseases.
RESULTS: Thirty-one consecutive patients were recruited to undergo our ERP. Mean 
age of patients was 62.16 years. No patients died due to surgical complications. 
Nine of 31 patients experienced complications (29.03%), none requiring surgical 
intervention. According to Clavien grading, all complications were grade <2.
CONCLUSION: The application of our ERP to our patients undergoing RC and VIP 
neobladder contributed to reduce postoperative morbidity.

AIM: To investigate quality of life (QoL) domains with three forms of urinary 
diversions, including ileal conduit, MAINZ pouch, and orthotopic ileal 
neobladder after radical cystectomy in men with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 149 men underwent radical 
cystectomy and urinary diversion (70 ileal conduit, 16 MAINZ pouch, and 63 
orthotopic ileal neobladder). Different domains of QoL, including general and 
physical conditions, psychological status, social status, sexual life, 
diversion-related symptoms, and satisfaction with the treatment were assessed 
using an author constructed questionnaire. Assessment was performed at three 
months postoperatively.
RESULTS: In questions addressing psychological status, social status, and sexual 
life, patients with continent diversion had a more favorable outcome (P = 0.002, 
P = 0.01, and P = 0.002, respectively). The rate of erectile dysfunction did not 
differ significantly between the three groups (P = 0.21). The rate and global 
satisfaction was higher with the MAINZ pouch (68.7%) and ileal neobladder 
(76.2%) as compared with the ileal conduit group (52.8%) (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Continent urinary diversion after radical cystectomy provides better 
results in terms of QoL as compared with ileal conduit diversion.

Canada's first robotic-assisted totally intracorporeal orthotopic ileal 
neobladder.

QC.

Despite robotic-assisted radical cysto-prostatectomy being performed in several 
centres, the urinary diversion is most often performed extra-corporeal. A 
robotic intra-corporeal ileal neobladder is technically demanding and long-term 
functional outcome data is lacking. We performed a robotic intra-corporeal ileal 
neobladder in a 73-year-old man for muscle invasive non-metastatic bladder 
cancer. The total operative time was 6 hours 8 minutes. The estimated blood loss 
was 900 mL. There were no complications and he was discharged on day 12. The 
principles of open neobladder surgery were maintained, however key modifications 
were used to reduce technical difficulty and enable timely completion. We found 
that robotic intracorporeal ileal neobladder can be safely performed with an 
experienced robotic unit.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the postoperative recovery among patients undergoing 
orthotopic bladder substitution with sigmoid or ileal grafts.
METHODS: The clinical data and postoperative recovery (postoperative 
complications, continence recovery time and postoperative hospital stay) of 84 
patients receiving orthotopic bladder substitution with sigmoid or ileal grafts 
after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 84 cases, 70 had continent urinary reservoirs constructed, among 
whom 58 (aged 48-89 years) received an ileal neobladder (IN) and 12 (aged 28-80 
years) received a sigmoid neobladder (SN). The postoperative complications rate, 
continence recovery time and postoperative hospital stay in IN group was 29.3% 
(17/58), 91.4%, and 23.5 days, as compared to 58.3%(7/12) (P=0.04), 66.7% 
(P=0.03), and 25 days (P=0.04) in patients in SN group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A neobladder constructed from ileal grafts achieves better 
postoperative recovery results compared to a neobladder constructed from sigmoid 
grafts.

A 64-year-old man visited our hospital with the complaint of macrohematuria and 
bilateral hydronephrosis. He had undergone total cystectomy and ileal neobladder 
replacement under the diagnosis of muscle invasive bladder cancer (cT2bN0M0). 
Tetany due to hyperventilation syndrome appeared on postoperative day 42. Blood 
gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.260, pO2 148.1 mmHg, pCO2 20.7 
mmHg, HCO3 9.1 mmHg, BE -16.0 mmol/l). His condition was immediately improved 
after a urethral catheter was placed and sodium bicarbonate was administered. 
After re-removal of the urethral catheter, however, hyperventilation syndrome 
recurred. He was discharged from the hospital with the urethral catheter placed.

In January 2005, a 66-year-old man underwent radical cystectomy and ileal 
neobladder reconstruction for invasive bladder cancer. A total of 3 years after 
the cystectomy, left-side ureteral cancer was diagnosed, and a 
nephroureterectomy was carried out in May 2008. In October 2011, he complained 
of asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria. We detected multiple papillary 
pedunculated and broad-based tumors in the left side and the dome of the 
neobladder. The patient underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, 
and a pathological diagnosis of high-grade pTa urothelial carcinoma was made. A 
total of 4 months later, tumors recurred in the right side and anterior wall of 
the neobladder. We carried out transurethral resection of the bladder tumor 
again; the pathological diagnosis was high-grade pTa urothelial carcinoma with 
carcinoma in situ. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin instillation was carried out seven 
times into the neobladder, without any severe side-effects. Tumor recurrence was 
not observed up to 8 months after bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment.

Fast track surgery to reduce short-term complications following radical 
cystectomy and intestinal urinary diversion with Vescica Ileale Padovana 
neobladder: proposal for a tailored enhanced recovery protocol and preliminary 
report from a pilot study.

Italy.

OBJECTIVE: Different fast track programs for patients undergoing radical 
cystectomy (RC) can be found in the current literature. The aim of this work was 
to develop a new enhanced recovery protocol (ERP).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ERP was designed after a structured literature review 
focusing on reduced bowel preparation, standardized feeding, postoperative 
nausea, vomiting and pain control. In order to test the ERP, a pilot 
observational prospective cohort study was planned, enrolling all patients 
consecutively undergoing RC and Vescica Ileale Padovana (VIP) neobladder. These 
patients were compared with a matched group of subjects who had undergone RC and 
VIP neobladder before implementation of the ERP. To achieve good comparability, 
a propensity score-matching was performed. The primary aim was to assess the 
ERP's feasibility; the secondary outcome measures were early morbidity and 
mortality.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: After an exhaustive literature search and a 
multidisciplinary consultation, an ERP was designed. Nine consecutive patients 
participated in the pilot study and were compared to 13 patients treated before 
implementation of the ERP. We did not find any statistically significant 
difference in terms of mortality rate (none died peri- or postoperatively in 
both groups). The complication rate, according to the modified Clavien 
classification, was significantly lower in the ERP group (22.22 vs. 84.61%, p < 
0.004). The major limitations are the low number of patients enrolled to test 
the protocol and the lack of randomization for the comparative evaluations.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of our ERP was proven to be feasible in the 
management of patients undergoing RC and intestinal urinary diversion with VIP 
neobladder. The postoperative course was enhanced by a significant reduction in 
both nasogastric tube insertion and parenteral nutrition support, with early 
postoperative feeding. All these findings were associated with no deleterious 
effect on morbidity or mortality, indeed there was a reduced occurrence of 
postoperative complication rates.

We report a case of neobladder-rectal fistula that developed as an early 
postoperative complication of radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder 
construction procedures. A 75-year-old man underwent a radical cystectomy and 
orthotopic neobladder construction using Studer's method for locally invasive 
bladder cancer (cT2N0M0). The patient had severe watery diarrhea on 
postoperative day 20, and was diagnosed with a neobladder-rectal fistula based 
on cystography findings. We inserted a Foley catheter into the neobladder, and 
performed conservative treatment. Four months after development of the fistula, 
cystography revealed that it had spontaneously closed. A neobladder-rectal 
fistula is an extremely rare complication, with no other known reports. Herein, 
we present this case of neobladder-rectal fistula and discuss its formation, 
diagnosis and treatment, along with reference to previous reports of 
neobladder-vaginal fistulas.

Portugal. filipealpoim@gmail.com

We present a case of a 67-year-old patient with a history of augmentation 
ileocystoplasty 31 years ago following genitourinary tuberculosis. Radiological 
investigations performed due to asymptomatic microscopic haematuria revealed 
three contrast-enhancing polyps within the neobladder. The patient had 
enterocystoprostatectomy and histopathological examination of the neobladder 
revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma in all three polyps, together with a prostatic 
adenocarcinoma Gleason 7 (3+4). After adjuvant chemotherapy and 1 year of 
follow-up, he had no sign of clinical or radiological recurrence. Taking into 
consideration this rare case, we discuss the development of malignant tumours 
after the incorporation of intestinal segments in a urinary tract 
reconstruction, showing what relationship exists between secondary neoplastic 
growth, the primary disease and the type of urinary diversion utilised.

OBJECTIVES: To examine postoperative complications in a contemporary series of 
patients after radical cystectomy using a standardized reporting system, and to 
identify readily available preoperative risk factors.
METHODS: Using the modified Clavien-Dindo classification, we assessed the 90-day 
postoperative clinical course of 535 bladder cancer patients who underwent 
radical cystectomy and urinary diversion (ileal conduit n = 349, ileal 
neobladder n = 186) between June 2003 and February 2012 at a single institution. 
All Martin criteria for standardized reporting of complications were met. Uni- 
and multivariable analyses for prediction of complications were carried out; 
covariates included body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, age, sex, 
American Society of Anesthesiologists Score, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, prior 
abdominal or pelvic surgery, localized tumor and urinary diversion type.
RESULTS: The 90-day rates for overall (Clavien-Dindo classification I-V) and 
high-grade complications (Clavien-Dindo classification III-V), as well as 
mortality (Clavien-Dindo classification V), were 56.4, 18.7 and 3.9%, 
respectively. Infections (16.4%), bleeding (14.2%) and gastrointestinal 
complications (10.7%) were the most common adverse outcomes. Independent risk 
factors for overall complications were body mass index (odds ratio 1.08) and 
Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥3 (odds ratio 1.93). Risk factors for high-grade 
complications were Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥3 (odds ratio 1.86), American 
Society of Anesthesiologists Score ≥3 (odds ratio 1.92) and body mass index 
(odds ratio 1.07, all P < 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Radical cystectomy is associated with significant morbidity; 
nevertheless, the majority of complications are minor. Charlson Comorbidity 
Index, American Society of Anesthesiologists Score and body mass index might 
help to identify patients at risk for high-grade complications after radical 
cystectomy.

Risk of in-hospital complications after radical cystectomy for urinary bladder 
carcinoma: population-based follow-up study of 7608 patients.

King's College London, London, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of different in-hospital complications for 
patients undergoing a radical cystectomy (RC), as limited nationwide population 
data on short- and long-term complications after RC is available, despite it 
being the standard treatment for localised muscle-invasive urinary bladder 
cancer (UBC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 7608 persons underwent a RC after UBC diagnosis, 
as registered in the Swedish National Patient Register between 1964 and 2008. We 
estimated the frequency and incidences and calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Urinary tract infection/septicaemia was the most common complication 
following radical cystectomy, with an incidence of 90.4 per 1,000 person years. 
There was a higher risk of urinary tract infection among patients who had a 
continent cutaneous reservoir (HR: 1.11 (0.94-1.30) or orthotopic neobladder 
1.21 (1.05-1.39) than among those with ileal conduit. Similarly, continent 
cutaneous reservoir and orthotopic neobladder were associated with increased 
risks for wound and abdominal wall hernias, stones in the urinary tract, 
hydronephrosis and nephrostomy tube treatment, and kidney failure. In contrast, 
risk of bowel obstruction was lower among those with orthotopic neobladder than 
those with ileal conduit (HR: 0.64 (0.50-0.81)) and those with continent 
cutaneous reservoir (HR: 0.92 (0.73-1.16).
CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital complications after RC are numerous and continue to 
accumulate for many years after surgery, indicating the need for life-long 
follow-up of these patients. Comparison between different types of diversion 
should, however, be made with care because of potential confounding by 
indication.

Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Erosion of the reservoir into surrounding tissues is a rare 
complication after inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation.
AIM: To present a new case and a review of the literature including discussion 
of pathogenesis, risk factors, and management options.
METHODS: We present the case of a 75-year-old male who underwent placement of an 
IPP for postoperative erectile dysfunction with a history of bladder cancer 
requiring radical cystoprostatectomy and Studer neobladder. Six years after IPP 
placement, he presented with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection that 
seemed to be precipitated by cycling of his penile prosthesis. Cystoscopy and 
cross-sectional computed tomography imaging demonstrated erosion of the 
inflatable penile prosthesis reservoir into the neobladder.
RESULTS: Patient underwent open removal of the IPP reservoir and cystorrhaphy 
with a plan for future prefascial reimplantation of an IPP reservoir.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a history of abdomino-pelvic surgery or radiation 
therapy, the retroperitoneal space may be extremely fibrotic and the 
transversalis fascia may have thickened. Potential intraoperative complications 
as well as reservoir erosion may be avoided by using a two-piece device or 
ectopic reservoir placement. Management options for reservoir erosion include 
explantation of the entire device as well as reservoir removal with salvage of 
remaining components.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate enterocystometry, voiding 
pattern and urine leakage of four types of orthotopic bladder substitute.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: At eight urological departments, 78 consecutive men were 
studied: 66 with an ileal neobladder [30 Studer pouches (S), 24 Hautmann pouches 
(H) and 12 T-pouches (T)] and 12 with a right colonic [Goldwasser type (G)] 
neobladder. Enterocystometry, determination of residual urine, micturition 
protocol and 24 h pad weight test were performed 6 and 12 months 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: Colonic neobladders had higher pouch pressure at first desire, normal 
desire and strong desire than ileal neobladders (except at first and normal 
desire at 12 months) (p < 0.02) and contraction was present more often at both 6 
and 12 months (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01). Compliance was good in all types of 
pouch. Intermittent self-catheterization was more common in H patients at 6 
months (p = 0.033). All patients with colonic neobladders used pads during the 
day and night. In patients with ileal pouches 32% used pads during the day and 
70% during the night at 12 months. Urine leakage was higher in patients with 
colonic bladders at 6 and 12 months during the day (mean/median of 98/31 ml and 
82/16 ml versus 10/0 ml and 4/0 ml, p < 0.001). T-pouches had excellent day-time 
continence, but nocturnal leakage was high.
CONCLUSIONS: The Hautmann pouch and the Studer pouch behaved similarly at 
enterocystometry and clinically, and continence was good in the majority of 
patients. The low number of patients with the other two types of pouch precludes 
definitive statements.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Urethra-sparing has become a standard in patients undergoing 
radical cystectomy for bladder cancer showing excellent oncologic outcome in 
large retrospective studies. However, data on functional outcome and quality of 
life are still conflicting. This review aims to summarize recent data on 
oncologic and functional outcome of patients undergoing orthotopic urinary 
diversion.
RECENT FINDINGS: Orthotopic urinary diversion can be performed safely in 
patients with negative urethral resection margins in frozen section analysis. 
Minimally invasive cystectomy shows short-term and long-term oncologic outcomes 
comparable with open cystectomy. In the meantime, more than 150 cases of total 
intracorporeal diversion have been published demonstrating promising 
perioperative results. However, only few data exist on functional outcome of 
this procedure. For open neobladder substitution, there is still a broad 
variability in continence rates, voiding function and health-related quality of 
life between different studies. However, the number of studies using validated 
tools for assessment of functional outcome is constantly increasing showing 
promising long-term outcomes of the procedure.
SUMMARY: Both in men and in women, orthotopic neobladder should be considered as 
standard-of-care with excellent long-term oncologic and functional outcome. Due 
to lack of long-term functional and oncologic data, total intracorporeal 
diversion should be limited to selected patients and centers with broad 
expertise in robotic surgery.

OBJECTIVES: To report the surgical outcomes of laparoscopic radical cystectomy 
(LRC) with extracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder (OIN) in patients with 
muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2009 and December 2011, 37 patients with 
muscle-invasive UCB underwent a LRC with OIN. Indications included (a) 
muscle-invasive UCB T2-4a, N0-Nx, M0; (b) high-risk and recurrent 
non-muscle-invasive tumors; (c) T1G3 plus CIS; and (d) extensive 
non-muscle-invasive disease that could not be controlled by transurethral 
resection and intravesical therapy. Demographic data, perioperative, and 
postoperative variables were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: The median operating time was 330 min, with a median estimated blood 
loss of 410 ml. Median length of stay was 12 days, and the mean length of the 
skin incision to extract the specimen and for the configuration of the 
neobladder was 7 ± 1 cm. The complication rate was 21.6 % (Clavien II). No 
Clavien III-V complications were reported. Daytime and nocturnal continence were 
preserved in 95 and 78 %, respectively. No local recurrence or port site 
metastasis occurred. Median time to disease recurrence was 14 months (IQR 9-24), 
and 1-year cancer-specific survival was 91.9 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy with extracorporeal ileal 
neobladder is a challenging procedure but technically feasible, allowing low 
morbidity and oncological safety. Long-term oncological results are required to 
definitely recognize this procedure as a standard treatment for bladder cancer.

A 30-year-old man presented with micturition pain and was diagnosed with a 
submucosal tumor in the right wall of the bladder with metastasis to the right 
obturator lymph node. Transurethral resection led to a diagnosis of invasive 
malignant pheochromocytoma. Radical cystectomy, neobladder reconstruction and 
bilateral iliac lymph node dissection were performed. Genetic analysis revealed 
succinate dehydrogenase B-associated hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma 
syndrome. 10 months after the operation, he had no evidence of recurrence.

Incontinence in the patients with neobladder is a distressing condition. 
Although conservative management may be helpful in some, a significant number of 
patients require some form of surgical intervention. Any surgical intervention, 
especially from the abdominal route can be significantly morbid in these 
patients because of extensive surgery done previously. There is a need for a 
technique that can take care of the postoperative incontinence without 
subjecting the patient to significant surgical risk. Artificial sphincters have 
been used in male patients but their use in female patients can be technically 
difficult. There are limited options available for women like transurethral 
bulking agents and pubovaginal slings. These procedures do not have very good 
results and female patients often end up with a cutaneous stoma. We, in this 
report, describe a female patient with incontinence after orthotopic neobladder 
reconstruction that could be successfully treated with transobturator taping.

BACKGROUND: Although open radical cystectomy (ORC) remains the gold standard of 
care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, robot-assisted radical cystectomy 
(RARC) continues to gain wider acceptance. In this article, we focus on the 
steps of RARC, describing our approach, which has been developed over the past 
10 yr. Totally intracorporeal RARC aims to offer the benefits of a complete 
minimally invasive approach while replicating the oncologic outcomes of open 
surgery.
OBJECTIVE: We report our outcomes of a totally intracorporeal RARC procedure, 
describing step by step our technique and highlighting the variations on this 
standard template of nerve-sparing and female organ-preserving approaches in men 
and women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2003 and October 2012, a 
total of 113 patients (94 male and 19 female) underwent totally intracorporeal 
RARC.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: We performed RARC, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, 
and a totally intracorporeal urinary diversion (UD) in all patients. In the 
accompanying video, we focus on the standard template for RARC, also describing 
nerve-sparing and female organ-preserving approaches.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Complications and oncologic 
outcomes are reported, including overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific 
survival (CSS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: RARC with intracorporeal UD was performed in 113 
patients. Mean age was 64 yr (range: 37-84). Forty-three patients underwent 
intracorporeal ileal conduit, and 70 had intracorporeal neobladder. On surgical 
pathology, 48% of patients had ≤ pT1 disease, 27% had pT2 disease, 13% had pT3 
disease, and 12% had pT4 disease. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 21 
(range: 0-57). Twenty percent of patients had lymph node-positive disease. 
Positive surgical margins occurred in six cases (5.3%). Median follow-up was 25 
mo (range: 3-107). We recorded a total of 70 early complications (0-30 d) in 54 
patients (47.8%), with 37 patients (32.7%) having Clavien grade ≥ 3. Thirty-six 
late complications (>30 d) were recorded in 30 patients (26.5%), with 20 
patients (17.7%) having Clavien grade ≥ 3. One patient (0.9%) died within 90 
days of operation from pulmonary embolism. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, CSS was 
81% at 3 yr and 67% at 5 yr.
CONCLUSIONS: Our structured approach to RARC has enabled us to develop this 
complex service while maintaining patient outcomes and complication rates 
comparable with ORC series. Our results demonstrate acceptable oncologic 
outcomes and encouraging long-term CSS rates.

BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with totally intracorporeal 
neobladder diversion is a complex procedure that has been reported with good 
outcomes in small series.
OBJECTIVE: To present complications and oncologic and functional outcomes of 
this procedure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2003 and 2012 in a tertiary referral 
center, 70 patients were operated on by two experienced robotic surgeons. Data 
were collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively.
INTERVENTION: RARC with totally intracorporeal modified Studer ileal neobladder 
formation.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The overall outcome of RARC with 
a totally intracorporeal neobladder was presented by assessing (1) surgical 
margins, (2) recurrence or cancer-specific death at 24 mo, (3) 30-d and 90-d 
complications graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system, (4) daytime 
and nighttime continence (no or one pad per day) at 6 and 12 mo, and (5) 
satisfactory sexual activity or potency at 6 mo and 12 mo. Survival rates were 
estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Median follow-up of the cohort was 30.3 mo 
(interquartile range: 12.7-35.6). We recorded negative margins in 69 of 70 
patients (98.6%). Clavien 3-5 complications occurred in 22 of 70 patients 
(31.4%) at 30 d and 13 of 70 (18.6%) at >30 d. At 90 d, the overall complication 
rate was 58.5%. Clavien <3 and Clavien ≥3 complications were recorded in 15 of 
70 patients (21.4%) and 26 of 70 (37.1%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates 
for recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival at 24 mo were 80.7%, 
88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. Daytime continence and satisfactory sexual 
function or potency at 12 mo ranged between 70% and 90% in both men and women. 
Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, selection bias due 
to the learning curve phase, and missing data.
CONCLUSIONS: In this expert center for RARC, outcomes after RARC with totally 
intracorporeal neobladder diversion appear satisfactory and in line with 
contemporary open series.

Dipping technique for ureteroileal anastomosis in orthotopic ileal neobladder: 
20-year experience in 670 patients-no stenosis with preservation of the upper 
tract.

Objectives. Many techniques were described for ureteroileal anastomosis in 
orthotopic bladder substitution, ranging from nonrefluxing to refluxing 
techniques, all aiming at preservation of the upper tract. We describe our 
technique of dipping the ureter into the ileal pouch, which is simple and had no 
complications. Patients and Methods. Our technique implies dipping the ureter in 
the lateral side of the pouch, in right and left corners, with two rows of four 
sutures fixing the seromuscular layer of the ureter to the seromuscular layer of 
the ileal pouch. The procedure was applied in both normal ureteric calibre and 
dilated ureter. Total number of procedures done was 1,340 ureters in 670 
patients after radical cystectomy for invasive carcinoma of the bladder of 
urothelial and nonurothelial cancer. Results. Followup of patients every six 
months and onward did not show stenosis in the ureteroileal anastomotic site. 
Filling of the ureter with contrast dye on ascending pouchogram was observed in 
patients who had considerably dilated ureters at the time of cystectomy. Normal 
ureter did not show clinical reflux but radiological filling of the ureter when 
the intravesical pressure exceeded the leak point pressure. Time to perform the 
dipping technique was 5-7 minutes for each site. Conclusion. Dipping technique 
for ureteroileal anastomosis in orthotopic ileal neobladder avoids the incidence 
of stenosis, preserves the upper tract, is a fast procedure, stands the 
evaluation in long-term followup, and was practiced successfully for twenty 
years.

[Research progress of common mode in urinary diversion after radical 
cystectomy].

OBJECTIVE: To sum up the common mode in urinary diversion after radical 
cystectomy.
METHODS: The recent original articles about the common mode in urinary diversion 
after radical cystectomy were extensively reviewed.
RESULTS: Urinary diversion includes no continent ureterocutaneostomy, continent 
ureterocutaneostomy and orthotopic neobladder. Ileal conduit, an ideal procedure 
of urinary diversion, has been widely used in patients after radical cystectomy 
and it is uncertain whether the health related quality of life in patients 
undergoing orthotopic ileal neobladder is superior to those undergoing ileal 
conduit. A series of basic researches of tissue engineering show a wide prospect 
of clinical application in the future.
CONCLUSION: Intestinal segment will remain the main material for urinary 
diversion and bladder reconstruction in a long time. Tissue engineering 
materials may be ideal for the substitution of bladder, and tissue engineering 
becomes the ultimate approach to solve the problem of missing bladder.

University Bangkok, Thailand.

OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy is now widely performed in cases of 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The present study experience with laparoscopic 
radical cystectomy using an ileal neobladder in which urethra-neobladder 
anastomosis was successfully performed intracorporeally
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between March and November 2009, five patients underwent 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy using an ileal neobladder with 
urethra-neobladder anastomosis. Preoperative characteristics, operative data, 
and results were analyzed.
RESULTS: The operation was successful for all patients. The mean operative time 
was 6 hours and 30 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 560 ml. No 
intraoperative complications occurred. Mean hospital stay was 19.6 days. Mean 
Foley catheter indwelled time was 18 days. Return of bowel function took 4.8 
days. Mean time to remove silastic drain was 14.2 days. After Foley catheter 
removal, all patients spontaneously voided without difficulty.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy of ileal neobladders using 
intracorporeal urethra-neobladder anastomosis is technically feasible. This 
technique takes advantage of laparoscopic surgery, good visualization, 
additional stitches, and more secure anastomosis.

Ashkelon, Israel. cambell@netvision.net.il

PURPOSES: We retrospectively assessed our experience with the W-shaped 
orthotopic ileal pouch, which was constructed with non-absorbable titanium 
staples. For these purpose, we discuss the results of bladder capacity, urinary 
continence and early and long-term postoperative complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included in the study 17 patients who underwent 
radical cystoprostatectomy followed by construction of an orthotopic W-shaped 
ileal pouch between October 2000 and November 2009. A 65-70 cm segment of ileum 
was isolated and prearranged into a W-configuration, leaving two 10 cm intact 
segments on both sides of the ileal fragment. In our technique we entirely 
anatomized all adjacent limbs in order to create a sphere-shaped pouch. The 
ureters were directly anastomized to both intact segments of the ileal division. 
All our patients underwent pouchscopy 6 months after operation and annually.
RESULTS: Mean operative time for neobladder reconstruction and ureteral 
anastomoses was 87 ± 7.67 minutes. In one patient a leak from the ileo-ileal 
anastomosis was confirmed on the 3rd day after operation. In 2 cases unilateral 
stricture of the ureteral-neobladder anastomosis was documented. Staple lines 
were mostly covered with ileal mucosa after 6 months. The mean functional 
bladder capacity was 340 ± 27.6 mL and 375 ± 43.4 mL at 6 and 12 months, 
respectively. First-year daytime and nighttime continence was good and 
acceptable in 90% and 78% of patients, while it increased to 95% during the 2nd 
year.
CONCLUSIONS: The long term follow-up shows that non-absorbable titanium staples 
can be safely used for creation of an orthotopic ileal neobladder. However, 
these data should be further validated in a larger series of patients.

Medicine, Rangsit University Bangkok, Thailand. tncclinic@gmail.com

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radical cystectomy (RC) remains the gold standard for 
muscle-invasive, organ-confined urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder 
Recently, laparoscopic surgery has been used increasingly by urologists as a 
minimally invasive procedure to treat neoplasms of the pelvic organs. The 
present study aimed to report technical aspects of the experience of treating 
Thailand first case of RC with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and ileal 
neobladder under the totally intracorporeal laparoscopic technique.
CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old Thai male patient presented with intermediate-grade 
muscle- invasive UC of the bladder with negative metastatic workout. 
Laparoscopic radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed using 
5 abdominal ports. Hemostasis was performed with bipolar forceps and vascular 
clips. The authors performed U-shape ileal neobladder and anastomosis using the 
completely intracorporeal laparoscopic technique. The operative time was 10 
hours, the estimated blood loss was 1,000 ml, and there were no serious 
complications. The ureteric stents were removed after the 7th day, the tube 
drain was removed after the 10th day, and the Foley catheter was removed after 
the 21th day. The post-operative pathologic report indicated intermediate-grade 
muscle-invasive UC and free resection margin.
CONCLUSION: The authors initial experience in Laparoscopic Radical cystectomy 
with totally intracorporeal ileal neobladder demonstrated that it was a feasible 
treatment modality. However more cases are required in the future to confirm its 
efficacy and improve laparoscopic technical performance in the treatment of 
organ-confined UC.

INTRODUCTION: Radical cystoprostatectomy remains the gold standard treatment for 
muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, given the treatment related 
complications of compromised potency and continence with this procedure, 
prostate/sexuality sparing cystectomy in orthotopic neobladder candidates has 
emerged in an effort to minimize these quality of life concerns. Recent evidence 
suggests only a marginal functional benefit from these technical refinements. We 
sought to determine the incidence of occult prostate cancer and urothelial 
cancer of the prostate in cystoprostatectomy specimens conducted for muscle 
invasive bladder cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 83 male patients who underwent radical 
cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer between April 2004 and 
March 2007. The median age of our study group was 71 years. Pathologic findings 
of prostate/urothelial cancer in the prostate were identified. Clinically 
significant prostate cancer was defined as Gleason score >6, tumour volume 
>0.5cc, extracapsular extension or perineural invasion.
RESULTS: Our review yielded a 30% (±10%, 0.95 CI) rate of prostate cancer, with 
19% (± 8.5%, 0.95 CI) of total specimens being positive for clinically 
significant prostate cancer. Urothelial cancer in the prostate was identified in 
16% (±8.5%, 0.95 CI) of patients, with an overlap with prostate cancer in 2 
patients. The overall rate of an underlying cancer within the prostate of our 
cystoprostatectomy specimens was about 46% (±10.7%, 0.95 CI).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the oncological risk of leaving behind 
residual cancer may not justify the practice of prostate-sparing cystectomies.

The standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer is surgical removal of 
the bladder and construction of a neobladder. Recently, important improvements 
have been made in the potential for bladder-conserving treatment using 
radiotherapy. External beam radiotherapy has undergone technological 
improvements, as a result of which it is possible to radiate the tumour more 
precisely while decreasing radiation to healthy tissue. Radiochemotherapy 
improves local recurrence-free and overall survival compared with radiotherapy 
alone. The results of this combined treatment are comparable with those of 
surgery. Additionally, Dutch radiotherapy departments have collected data in a 
national database of 1040 selected patients with confined bladder cancer. These 
patients were treated with external beam radiation, limited surgery and 
brachytherapy. The 5-year local recurrence-free survival was 75%. Bladder 
conserving treatment options for muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be 
discussed during the multidisciplinary meeting.

OBJECTIVES: Despite the growing trend in the development of orthotopic 
neobladders, the procedure cannot be performed in many cases, thereby retaining 
the validity of other techniques. We propose a comparative analysis between 
patients with radical cystectomy for bladder neoplasm and reconstruction using 
the ileal conduit (IC) or ureterosigmoidostomy (USG).
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Observational retrospective study on 255 patients with 
radical cystectomy between 1985 and 2009, selecting group assignments by the use 
of IC and USG. Analysis of the demographic and preoperative characteristics, 
perioperative complications, pathology and medium to long-term complications. 
Comparison of groups using T-Student, U-Mann-Whitney and chi square tests, with 
P<.05 indicating statistical significance. Preparation of survival tables 
according to Kaplan-Meier, establishing comparisons using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: There were 41 cases of IC and 55 cases of USG, with a mean patient age 
of approximately 61 years. USGs were performed on a greater number of females 
than ICs. There were no differences in the need for transfusion, with similar 
results as other series. There was a greater trend towards the appearance of 
intestinal fistulae and greater morbidity and mortality in the postoperative 
period in USG, although it was not significant. There was a greater long-term 
presence of eventrations in IC, and of pyelonephritis and the need for taking 
alkalinizing agents in USG. The appearance of peristomal hernias in IC was less 
than in previous series. With a mean follow-up greater than 50 months, the 
overall survival was 40% at 5 years, with no differences according to urinary 
diversion.
CONCLUSIONS: IC and USG are two applicable urinary diversions in the event that 
orthotopic neobladder surgery cannot be performed. They have a similar long-term

AIMS: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a known possibility after radical 
cystectomy (RC) and orthotopic neobladder (ONB) urinary diversion. We 
retrospectively reviewed the outcomes and complications of patients who 
underwent artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement for treatment of SUI and 
evaluated potential risk factors (PRFs) for AUS failure.
METHODS: Patients who underwent AUS placement after RC/ONB from 1994 to 2009 
were identified. Variables evaluated included: demographics, cancer type, AUS 
characteristics, urinary incontinence (UI), revision procedures data, and PRFs 
for AUS failure.
RESULTS: Demographic data was reviewed on 36 patients. Mean age at AUS placement 
was 72 (58-79) years. Mean time to AUS after RC/ONB was 28 (2-120) months. Mean 
follow up after AUS was 40 (2-132) months. TCC was the indication for RC in 94% 
of patients. The most commonly placed AUS cuff and reservoir size was 4.5 cm and 
61-70 H2 O, respectively. Incontinence data was available in 29 patients. 
Pre-AUS placement 22, 3, and 4 patients were totally, daytime and nighttime only 
incontinent, respectively. Post-AUS placement, incontinence persisted in 5, 1, 
and 2 patients with total, daytime and nighttime incontinence, respectively. 
Prior to AUS placement 11/36 patients received chemotherapy and 10/36 had 
radiation. Mean time to the first revision/explantation due to 
UI/erosion/infection/malfunction was an average of 28 (3-96) months after AUS 
placement and occurred in 21/35 (60%) patients. There was no significant 
correlation noted between PRFs and UI pre-/post-AUS or between PRFs and the need 
for AUS revision.
CONCLUSIONS: AUS is a safe, effective treatment with an acceptable complication 
rate for patients after RC/ONB with SUI.

We report here a case of rupture of a substitute urinary bladder due to a 
relapse of bladder cancer detected incidentally on a bone scan. The 
radionuclides used in bone scans accumulate in the bone and are excreted in the 
urine. Incidental detection of rupture of a substitute urinary bladder may lead 
to appropriate intermediate neobladder repair.

INTRODUCTION: Standardized methods of reporting complications after radical 
cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversions (UD) are necessary to evaluate the 
morbidity associated with this operation to evaluate the modified Clavien 
classification system (CCS) in grading perioperative complications of RC and UD 
in a real life cohort of patients with bladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of patients treated with RC and UD 
from April 2011 to March 2012 at 19 centers in Italy was evaluated. 
Complications were recorded according to the modified CCS. Results were 
presented as complication rates per grade. Univariate and binary logistic 
regression analysis were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: 467 patients were enrolled. Median age was 70 years 
(range 35-89). UD consisted in orthotopic neobladder in 112 patients, ileal 
conduit in 217 patients and cutaneous ureterostomy in 138 patients. 415 
complications were observed in 302 patients and were classified as Clavien type 
I (109 patients) or II (220 patients); Clavien type IIIa (45 patients), IIIb (22 
patients); IV (11 patients) and V (8 patients). Patients with cutaneous 
ureterostomy presented a lower rate (8%) of CCS type ≥IIIa (p = 0.03). A longer 
operative time was an independent risk factor of CCS ≥III (OR: 1.005; CI: 
1.002-1.007 per minute; p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, RC is associated with a significant morbidity (65%) 
and a reduced mortality (1.7%) when compared to previous experiences. The 
modified CCS represents an easily applicable tool to classify the complications 
of RC and UD in a more objective and detailed way.

Korea.

PURPOSE: Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion are the standard treatment for 
invasive bladder cancer. We analyzed the long-term (>10 years postoperatively) 
functional outcomes, complications, and urodynamic findings in a single center 
series of patients who underwent cystectomy and a Studer ileal neobladder 
substitution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 108 Studer pouches 
constructed during 1990 and 2011 was performed. Data were analyzed in terms of 
long-term (>10 years) outcomes. Complications, incontinence, voiding 
difficulties, upper urinary tract changes, overall satisfaction, and urodynamic 
findings of the reservoir were obtained.
RESULTS: We evaluated 19 out of 50 patients who had lived for over 10 years 
postoperatively. Another 31 patients were not traced: 7 patients died following 
recurrence, 15 died due to exacerbation of a comorbidity, and 9 patients were 
lost to follow-up. Concerning complications, 6 patients had an atrophied kidney, 
5 patients had moderate hydronephrosis, 5 patients had chronic recurrence of 
pylelonephritis, and 2 patients had voiding difficulty because of bladder neck 
stricture due to clean intermittent catheterization. One patient underwent an 
operation due to intestinal obstruction. Seven patients had incontinence; all 7 
patients showed intermittently at night and 2 patients even in waking hours. 
Maximum bladder capacity was 484.1±119.2 mL, maximum flow rate was 13.6±9.7 
mL/sec, and post-void residual urine volume was 146.8±82.7 mL.
CONCLUSION: Long-term outcomes with the Studer orthotopic ileal neobladder have 
an acceptable complication rate and good functional results. However, potential 
adverse outcomes such as renal deterioration, dysfunctional voiding should also 
be considered.

PURPOSE: In recent years the orthotopic neobladder has gained increasing 
popularity in patients who undergo radical cystectomy. However, there are only a 
few reports of orthotopic neobladders reconstructed from the sigmoid without 
detubularization. We investigated the complications and functional outcomes of 
the orthotopic sigmoid neobladder reconstructed using our detaenial technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of the detaenial 
sigmoid neobladder in 210 consecutive patients who underwent radical cystectomy 
at our institution from January 2003 to March 2010. ANOVA was used to 
investigate urodynamic finding differentials with time. Univariable and 
multivariable analyses were done to determine factors influencing continence.
RESULTS: Median followup was 48 months. Early complications (90 days or less) 
were observed in 65 patients (31%). Late complications (greater than 90 days) 
were observed in 45 patients (21.5%). Five-year daytime and nighttime complete 
continence rates were 74.6% and 57.1%, respectively. Younger age was the only 
independent factor associated with complete continence during the day (OR 2.342, 
95% CI 1.803-3.041, p <0.001) and night (OR 1.193, 95% CI 1.087-1.310, p 
<0.001). Mean maximal capacity and post-void residual urine were 328.8 and 22.2 
ml, respectively. The mean maximal flow rate was 18.5 ml per second. The mean 
end filling pressure, pressure at maximal capacity and maximal intravesical 
pressure were 35.8, 55 and 60.6 cm H2O, respectively. These parameters remained 
stable with time (each p >0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that detaenial sigmoid neobladder is a safe, 
feasible alternative for urinary diversion.

PURPOSE: To evaluate postoperative renal function and risk factors for the loss 
of renal function in patients who had undergone radical cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single institutional study evaluated 70 
patients, including 54 men and 16 women who underwent radical cystectomy. The 
median follow-up period was 34.5 months (range, 12 to 228 months). In this 
cohort, four types of urinary diversions were studied, including ileal 
neobladder (n = 24), ileocecal neobladder (n = 12), ileal conduit (n = 25), and 
cutaneous ureterostomy (n = 9). Postoperative changes in renal function were 
reviewed, and the estimated serum creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) was calculated. The variables analyzed were age, a prior history of 
hypertension or diabetes mellitus, pre-operative renal function, type of urinary 
diversion, the postoperative occurrence of acute pyelonephritis, and the 
presence of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The mean eGFR was 74.6 (range, 15.2 to 155.1) mL/min/1.73 m² before 
surgery and 63.6 (range, 8.7 to 111.5) mL/min/1.73 m² at the last follow-up. The 
10-year renal deterioration-free interval was 63.8%. Multivariate analysis 
showed that a postoperative episode of acute pyelonephritis [Odds Ratio (OR), 
3.21; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.14 to 9.02; P = .03] and the presence of 
chemotherapy (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.33 to 8.01; P = .01) were significant adverse 
factors.
CONCLUSION: Twenty-four (34.2%) patients demonstrated reduced renal function 
during the follow-up period. Postoperative episodes of acute pyelonephritis and 
the presence of chemotherapy were found to be significant adverse factors.

One of the commonest forms of orthotopic bladder substitution for bladder cancer 
survivors, used in our institute, is the use of ileocecal segment. Sometimes, 
the need for Indiana pouch heterotropic continent diversion arises.
AIM: To compare the long-term effect of orthotopic ileocecal bladder and 
heterotropic Indiana pouch following radical cystectomy in bladder cancer 
patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2011, 91 patients 
underwent radical cystectomy/anterior pelvic exentration and orthotopic 
ileocecal bladder reconstruction (61 patients) and Indiana pouch (30 patients), 
when orthotopic diversion could not be technically or oncologically feasible.
RESULTS: Convalescence was uneventful in most patients. All minor and major 
urinary leakage cases, in both diversions groups, where successfully 
conservatively treated. Only one patient in the ileocecal group with major 
urinary leak required re-exploration with successful revision of uretro-colonic 
anastomosis. Only one patient in the Indiana pouch group had accidentally 
discovered sub-centimetric stone, which was simply expelled. The overall 
survival proportion of ileocecal group was 100% compared to 80% in the Indiana 
pouch group (p<0.001). The disease free survival proportion of ileocecal group 
was 90.8% compared to 80% in the Indiana pouch group (p=0.076). Effective 
comparative daytime and nighttime urinary continence as well as renal function 
deterioration were not statistically significant between both reconstruction 
types.
CONCLUSION: Both ileocecal bladder and Indiana pouch are safe procedures in 
regard to long-term effects over kidney function following radical cystectomy.

PURPOSE: Women undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion for 
bladder cancer experience substantial limitations in health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL). However, the level of discomfort caused by different urinary 
diversion has been never evaluated in long term survivors. The aim of this 
multicenter study is to evaluate differences in HRQOL among recurrence-free 
women undergoing cutaneous ureterostomy (CUS), Bricker's ileal conduit (BK-IC) 
and Orthotopic neobladder VIP (ONB-VIP) in disease-free females treated with 
radical cystectomy (RC), with long-term follow up (mean 60.1 months; range 
36-122 months).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutively treated female patients from two 
urological institutions who underwent RC and urinary diversion from January 2000 
to December 2008, with no evidence of tumor recurrence at a minimum follow up of 
36 months, were included. Patients received the European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) generic (QLQ-C30) and bladder 
cancer-specific instruments (QLQ-BLM30) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy for Bladder Cancer (FACT-BL). Clinical data and questionnaire results 
were analyzed in order to evaluate the HRQOL differences among diversion groups.
RESULTS: We identified 37 females (median age: 68, range 45-82 years), including 
12 status-post CUS, 16 who underwent BK-IC, and 9 who underwent ONB-VIP. Most 
were healthy (24/37 with no comorbidities, 4/37 Charlson 1-2, 9/37 Charlson 3 or 
greater - we didn't considered bladder cancer in Charlson evaluation because 
bladder cancer was the main inclusion criteria). Women undergoing CUS endorsed 
worse FACT-BL scores compared with BK-IC and ONB-VIP patients, worse HRQOL 
regarding physical and emotional well-being (p=0.008 and p=0.02, respectively), 
and a trend toward worse EORTC QLQ-C30 scores for appetite loss and fatigue 
(p=0.05 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study long-term disease-free females treated with CUS 
endorsed worse HRQOL compared with women who underwent BK-IC or ONB-VIP, mostly 
due to worse physical and emotional perception of their body image.

Novel prototype sewing device, EndoSew®, for minimally invasive surgery: an 
extracorporeal ileal conduit construction pilot study in 10 patients.

Roth B(1), Birkhäuser FD, Thalmann GN, Zehnder P.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The EndoSew(®) 
prototype was first tested in a porcine model several years ago. The 
investigators found it both simple to master and reliable, its greatest 
advantage being a 2.4-fold time saving compared with straight laparoscopic 
suturing. In addition to that publication, there is a single case report 
describing the performance of an open EndoSew(®) suture to close parts (16 cm) 
of an ileal neobladder. The time for suturing the 16 cm ileum was 25 min, which 
is in line with our experience. The knowledge on this subject is limited to 
these two publications. We report on the first consecutive series of ileal 
conduits performed in humans using the novel prototype sewing device EndoSew(®). 
The study shows that the beginning and the end of the suture process represent 
the critical procedural steps. It also shows that, overall, the prototype sewing 
machine has the potential to facilitate the intracorporeal suturing required in 
reconstructive urology for construction of urinary diversions.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of the novel prototype sewing 
device EndoSew(®) in placing an extracorporeal resorbable running suture for 
ileal conduits.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-centre pilot study of 10 
consecutive patients undergoing ileal conduit, in whom the proximal end of the 
ileal conduit was closed extracorporeally using an EndoSew(®) running suture. 
The primary endpoint was the safety of the device and the feasibility of the 
sewing procedure which was defined as a complete watertight running suture line 
accomplished by EndoSew(®) only. Watertightness was assessed using methylene 
blue intraoperatively and by loopography on postoperative days 7 and 14. 
Secondary endpoints were the time requirements and complications ≤30 days after 
surgery.
RESULTS: A complete EndoSew(®) running suture was feasible in nine patients; the 
suture had to be abandoned in one patient because of mechanical failure. In 
three patients, two additional single freehand stitches were needed to anchor 
the thread and to seal tiny leaks. Consequently, all suture lines in 6/10 
patients were watertight with EndoSew(®) suturing alone and in 10/10 patients 
after additional freehand stitches. The median (range) sewing time was 5.5 
(3-10) min and the median (range) suture length was 4.5 (2-5.5) cm. There were 
no suture-related complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The EndoSew(®) procedure is both feasible and safe. After 
additional freehand stitches in four patients all sutures were watertight. With 
further technical refinements, EndoSew(®) has the potential to facilitate the 
intracorporeal construction of urinary diversions.

Bladder replacement following radical cystectomy is widely practiced and in some 
centers has become the standard method of urinary diversion when possible, 
rather than the traditional ileal conduit. To minimize the impact of cystectomy 
and bladder replacement on quality of life and to obtain optimal functional 
results, postoperative care must be comprehensive and multidisciplinary. 
Critical team members include the surgeon, urologic nurses, WOC nurses, and 
allied health care providers such as physiotherapists. This article highlights 
postoperative considerations for patients undergoing radical cystectomy with 
orthotopic neobladder construction. The common issues and complications that 
arise are discussed with a focus on strategies to optimize outcomes.

PURPOSE: Benign ureterointestinal anastomotic stricture is not uncommon after 
radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. We studied the impact of the running 
vs the interrupted technique on the ureterointestinal anastomotic stricture 
rate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2007 to December 2008 interrupted end-to-side 
anastomoses were created and from January 2009 to July 2010 running anastomoses 
were created. The primary study end point was time to ureterointestinal 
anastomotic stricture.
RESULTS: Of 266 consecutive patients 258 were alive 30 days after radical 
cystectomy, including 149 and 109 with an interrupted and a running anastomosis, 
respectively. The groups did not differ in age, gender, body mass index, age 
adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, receipt of chemotherapy or radiation, blood 
loss, operative time, diversion type or postoperative pathological findings. The 
stricture rate per ureter was 8.5% (25 of 293) and 12.7% (27 of 213) in the 
interrupted and running groups, respectively (p = 0.14). Univariate analysis 
suggested that postoperative urinary tract infection (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.1, p 
= 0.04) and Clavien grade 3 or greater complications (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.9, p 
<0.01) were associated with ureterointestinal anastomotic stricture. On 
multivariate analysis postoperative urinary tract infection (HR 2.4, 95% CI 
1.2-5.1, p = 0.02) and running technique (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.7, p = 0.05) were 
associated with ureterointestinal anastomotic stricture. Median time to 
stricture and followup was 289 (IQR 120-352) and 351 days (IQR 132-719) in the 
running cohort vs 213 (IQR 123-417) and 497 days (IQR 174-1,289) in the 
interrupted cohort, respectively. Of the 52 strictures 33 (63%) developed within 
1 year. Kaplan-Meier analysis controlling for differential followup showed a 
trend toward higher freedom from stricture for the interrupted ureterointestinal 
anastomosis (p = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: A running anastomosis and postoperative urinary tract infection may 
be associated with ureterointestinal anastomotic stricture. Larger series with 
multiple surgeons are needed to confirm these findings.

The urethral anastomosis in extracorporeally constructed orthotopic neo-bladder 
following robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) remains a challenge. In 
principle either pre-posi-tioned single sutures or robotic continuous suture 
techniques can be applied. In the literature the different techniques are most 
often not described in detail. In the present work one example for each 
technique is given and the advantages and disadvantages of both methods are 
discussed.

INTRODUCTION: We examined the association between type of urinary diversion and 
quality of life (QoL) in patients who underwent radical cystectomy for primary 
bladder cancer using a validated, disease-specific instrument.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 314 consecutive patients treated with radical 
cystectomy and urinary diversion for primary bladder cancer between January 2000 
and December 2006 was analyzed. Participants were mailed the validated 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Vanderbilt Cystectomy Index (FACT-VCI) 
questionnaire. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were 
used to examine the association between type of urinary diversion (ileal conduit 
versus orthotopic neobladder) and QoL.
RESULTS: Eighty-four out of 168 (50% response rate) evaluable patients completed 
the FACT-VCI questionnaire. The median follow up duration was 5.6 years (range, 
2.1 to 9.3 years). ANOVA showed statistically significant differences favoring 
orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion with more favorable QoL scores on the 
FACT-VCI (mean difference 5.6 points, p = .03) and radical cystectomy-specific 
domain (mean difference 2.9 points, p = .05). However, multivariable linear 
regression analyses showed no statistically significant association between the 
type of urinary diversion and QoL (FACT-VCI: β = 4.1 points, p = .177; radical 
cystectomy-specific: β = 1.5 points, p = .390).
CONCLUSIONS: Type of urinary diversion was not associated with QoL after radical 
cystectomy. Randomized controlled trials comparing types of urinary diversion 
using validated, disease-specific QoL instruments are needed.

PURPOSE: To prospectively present the technique, functional and oncological 
outcome of internal genitalia sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer in 15 
selected women.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 2010, 305 women 
underwent orthotopic neobladder after radical cystectomy. Of these, 15 cases 
with a mean age of 42 years underwent genitalia sparing. Inclusion criteria 
included stage (T2b N0 Mo or less, as assessed preoperatively, unifocal tumors 
away from the trigone, sexually active young women and internal genitalia free 
of tumor. Cystectomy with preservation of the uterus, vagina and ovaries and 
Hautmann neobladder were performed. Oncological, functional, urodynamic and 
sexual outcome using Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Definitive histopathology showed advanced stage not recognized 
preoperatively in 2 patients, who developed local recurrence and bony metastasis 
after 3-4 months. A third patient developed bony metastasis after 15 months. No 
recurrence developed in the retained genital organs. The remaining 12 patients 
remained free of disease with a mean follow-up of 70 months. Among women 
eligible for functional evaluation, daytime and nighttime continence were 
achieved in 13/13 (100%) and 12/13 (92)%, respectively. Chronic urinary 
retention was not noted. The urodynamic parameters were comparable to those in 
other patients without genital preservation. Sexual function (FSFI) was better 
in these patients than in others without genital preservation.
CONCLUSIONS: Genital sparing cystectomy for bladder cancer is feasible in 
selected women. It provides a good functional outcome, better sexual function 
and the potential for fertility preservation. So far, the oncological outcome is 
favorable.

AIM: To compare the outcomes of laparoscopic (LRCP) and open radical 
cystoprostatectomy (ORCP) with orthotopic urinary diversion for muscle-invasive 
organ-confined bladder cancer by a single surgeon.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively documented 15 LRCP and 15 ORCP patients, 
followed for at least 3 years, were included in our study. The demographic 
parameters of patients, preoperative radiologic staging, previous operations, 
surgical outcomes, complications, oncologic results and intermediate-term 
follow-up, postoperative chemotherapy and follow-up periods were recorded and 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean oncologic follow-up was 3 years. Transfusion rate, estimated 
blood loss, oral intake and narcotic analgesic requirement were statistically 
less in the LRCP group (p < 0.05). However, operation time and hospital stay 
were similar in both groups. The complication rates were not significantly 
different between the two groups. The mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 
20.0 ± 1.7 in the ORCP and 22.6 ± 2.0 in the LRCP group. One patient in each 
group had a margin positive for bladder cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic approach may be feasible for muscle-invasive 
organ-confined bladder cancer. Furthermore, LRCP provides less blood loss, early 
oral intake and postoperative pain management. Additionally, continence and 
sexual function may be provided by LRCP as with ORCP.

    Eur Urol. 2013 Aug;64(2):225-6; discussion 227.

BACKGROUND: Long-term oncologic and functional outcomes after robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) for bladder cancer (BCa) are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To report oncologic and functional outcomes in a cohort of patients 
who have completed a minimum of 5 yr and a maximum of 8 yr of follow-up after 
RARC and extracorporeal urinary diversion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this paper, we report on the experience 
from one of the first European urology centres to introduce RARC. Only patients 
between 2004 and 2006 were included to ensure follow-up of ≥ 5 yr. We report on 
an analysis of oncologic outcomes in 14 patients (11 males and 3 females) with 
muscle-invasive/high-grade non-muscle-invasive or bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin-refractory carcinoma in situ who opted to have RARC.
INTERVENTION: RARC with pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed using the three-arm 
standard da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, CA, USA). Urinary 
diversion, either ileal conduit (n=12) or orthotopic neobladder (n=2), was 
constructed extracorporeally.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Parameters were recorded in a prospectively maintained 
database including assessment of renal function, overall survival, 
disease-specific survival, development of metastases, and functional outcomes.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Results were analysed using descriptive statistical 
analysis. Survival data were analysed and presented using the Kaplan-Meier 
survival curve.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Five of the 14 patients have died. Three patients died 
of metastatic disease, and two died of unrelated causes. Two other patients are 
alive with metastases, and another has developed primary lung cancer. Six 
patients are alive and disease-free. These results show overall survival of 64%, 
disease-specific survival of 75%, and disease-free survival of 50%. None of the 
patients had deterioration of renal function necessitating renal replacement 
therapy. Three of four previously potent patients having nerve-sparing RARC 
recovered erectile function. The study is limited by the relatively small number 
of highly selected patients undergoing RARC, which was a novel technique 8 yr 
ago. The standard da Vinci Surgical System made extended lymphadenectomy 
difficult.
CONCLUSIONS: Within limitations, in our experience RARC achieved excellent 
control of local disease, but the outcomes in patients with metastatic disease 
seem to be equivalent to the outcomes of open radical cystectomy.

Military Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Urine leakage is a common complication in patients with bladder 
cancer after radical cystectomy and neobladder reconstruction.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the use 
of urostomy bags in the management of urine leakage in patients with bladder 
cancer after radical cystectomy.
METHODS: Urine leakage during the perioperative period was retrospectively 
analyzed in 483 patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy 
from 2004 to 2010. Before 2008, all patients with urine leakages were treated by 
routine dressing changes (group A). After 2008, the leakages were managed with 
urostomy bags (group B). The perioperative quality of life (EQ-5D) and cost for 
urine leakage for both groups were compared in this controlled study.
RESULTS: The average cost in management of preoperative urine leakage was 
significantly higher in group A than in group B as well as the patients with 
extravasations of urine or lymphoceles. Patients in group B had an overall 
better perioperative life quality compared with group A. In particular, the 
score for pain/discomfort was significantly higher in group A than in group B.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of perioperative urine leakage with urostomy bags 
avoided constant body wetness and significantly increased the quality of life 
and reduced the special costs of urine leakage in patients with bladder cancer 
after cystectomy.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early use of urostomy bag is a good choice for 
perioperative urine leakage in patients with bladder cancer after radical 
cystectomy and neobladder reconstruction.

Austria.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the functional and 
oncological outcomes of orthotopic neobladders in women with urothelial cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1993 to 2007, 61 women underwent radical cystectomy 
and orthotopic ileal neobladder using the hemi-Kock pouch or Skinner T pouch. 
Sixteen of them were excluded owing to a lack of available follow-up data. 
Finally, 39 women with diagnosed TCC were included in this retrospective study. 
Demographic data, functional outcome including micturition characteristics such 
as voided volume, continence situation, use of clean intermittent 
catheterization (CIC), residual urine volume and recurrence rate were collected 
3, 6 and >12 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Tumours were non-muscle-invasive in 13 patients (pT1; 32.8%) with 
isolated carcinoma in situ (after failure of bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in five 
patients (13.0%) and muscle-invasive in 19 patients (pT2-3; 49.0%), extensive 
superficial bladder cancer was shown in one patient (2.6%), and remaining 
dysplasia after transurethral resection of the bladder for T1 G2 in one patient 
(2.6%). Median follow-up was 37 (range 3-165) months. Day-time (71.4%) and 
night-time (67.8%) continence (0-1 pad/24 h) 3 months postoperatively increased 
to 83.8% on long-term follow-up. Clean intermittent self-catheterization was 
required by 20%. At a mean follow-up of 39.5 (8-86) months, two women 
experienced local recurrence (septum rectovaginale, pelvic floor), urethral 
recurrence was seen in 5.2% and distant metastasis (pulmonary, peritoneal 
carcinosis) also in 5.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Orthotopic bladder replacement is an efficient option in 
appropriately selected women undergoing radical cystectomy, with encouraging 
functional outcome and low urethral recurrence rates, similar to published 
literature in men.

PURPOSE: Compared to the literature on other malignancies, data on quality of 
life (QoL) in bladder cancer are sparse. This study sought answers to the 
following questions: In what QoL domains do patients with bladder cancer differ 
from the general population? Do patients with radical cystectomy differ in QoL 
compared to those who received conservative treatment? Do patients with 
neobladder generally have better QoL compared to patients with other diversion 
methods?
METHODS: At the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation, N = 823 patients with 
bladder cancer were assessed. Data of a representative community sample 
(N = 2037) were used for comparison. The questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to 
measure QoL. Multivariate linear regression models were computed to investigate 
differences between groups.
RESULTS: Patients with both non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder 
cancer reported significantly more problems and worse functioning than the 
general population. Radiotherapy is associated with clinically relevant more 
pain, dyspnoea, constipation, appetite loss and decreased social functioning 
while chemotherapy is associated more with dyspnoea. Cystectomy patients 
reported more fatigue, appetite loss and decreased role functioning. Male 
patients ≥70 years with conduit experienced more sleep and emotional problems. 
These effects of urinary diversion were not observed in women and younger 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with bladder cancer experience various QoL concerns at the 
beginning of inpatient rehabilitation. These problems can partly be explained by 
the type of treatment the patients receive. Type of urinary diversion is 
relevant for QoL in subgroups of patients.

Bladder substitution following radical cystectomy for urothelial cancer 
(transitional cell carcinoma) has become increasingly common and in many centers 
has evolved to become the standard method of urinary diversion. In determining 
the best type of urinary diversion for a specific patient, consideration must be 
given to both the morbidity associated with surgery and the potential positive 
impact on the patient's quality of life. Decision-making and perioperative care 
is ideally multidisciplinary, involving physicians and nurse specialists in 
urology, continence, and ostomy therapy. Physiotherapists may also be involved 
for pelvic floor muscle retraining. This article highlights preoperative 
considerations for patients undergoing radical cystectomy with a focus on issues 
specific to orthotopic bladder substitution as the method of urinary diversion. 
The second article in this 2-part series will outline postoperative strategies 
to manage these patients.

PURPOSE: Orthotopic neobladder reconstruction is the preferred method of urinary 
diversion after radical cystoprostatectomy. We evaluated urinary functional 
outcomes in male patients after orthotopic neobladder using a patient 
questionnaire.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2009 patients with bladder cancer were 
enrolled in a clinical trial, randomly assigned to undergo T pouch or Studer 
pouch diversion after radical cystoprostatectomy. Male patients were mailed a 
questionnaire 12 or more months after surgery including items on urinary 
function, intermittent catheterization, number/size/wetness of pads and mucus 
leakage.
RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 68%. Mean followup was 4.5 years 
(range 1 to 8). Only 22.3% of patients did not use pads. In the daytime 47% of 
patients used at least 1 pad, 32.2% used small/mini pads and 22.6% used diapers. 
At night 72% used pads, 14.7% used small/mini pads and 38.9% used diapers. 
During the day and night 47% said their pads were dry/barely wet. Overall 62.5% 
of patients reported mucus leakage. Only 9.5% of patients performed clean 
intermittent self-catheterization, of whom 70.6% started clean intermittent 
self-catheterization within the first year after surgery. Increasing age and 
diabetes mellitus were predictors of urinary function (p = 0.005 and 0.03, 
respectively) but did not affect pad use.
CONCLUSIONS: Ileal orthotopic neobladder offers good functional results but most 
patients wear at least 1 pad and many require diapers at night. Increasing age 
and diabetes mellitus predict worse urinary function but are not associated with 
pad use. Emptying failure is uncommon and occurs early in the postoperative 
period. Pad size/wetness and mucus leakage should be considered when evaluating 
urinary incontinence.

CONTEXT: A summary of the 2nd International Consultation on Bladder Cancer 
recommendations on the reconstructive options after radical cystectomy (RC), 
their outcomes, and their complications.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature regarding indications, surgical details, 
postoperative care, complications, functional outcomes, as well as 
quality-of-life measures of patients with different forms of urinary diversion 
(UD).
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: An English-language literature review of data published 
between 1970 and 2012 on patients with UD following RC for bladder cancer was 
undertaken. No randomized controlled studies comparing conduit diversion with 
neobladder or continent cutaneous diversion have been performed. Consequently, 
almost all studies used in this report are of level 3 evidence. Therefore, the 
recommendations given here are grade C only, meaning expert opinion delivered 
without a formal analysis.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Indications and patient selection criteria have 
significantly changed over the past 2 decades. Renal function impairment is 
primarily caused by obstruction. Complications such as stone formation, urine 
outflow, and obstruction at any level must be recognized early and treated. In 
patients with orthotopic bladder substitution, daytime and nocturnal continence 
is achieved in 85-90% and 60-80%, respectively. Continence is inferior in 
elderly patients with orthotopic reconstruction. Urinary retention remains 
significant in female patients, ranging from 7% to 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: RC and subsequent UD have been assessed as the most difficult 
surgical procedure in urology. Significant disparity on how the surgical 
complications were reported makes it impossible to compare postoperative 
morbidity results. Complications rates overall following RC and UD are 
significant, and when strict reporting criteria are incorporated, they are much 
higher than previously published. Fortunately, most complications are minor 
(Clavien grade 1 or 2). Complications can occur up to 20 yr after surgery, 
emphasizing the need for lifelong monitoring. Evidence suggests an association 
between surgical volume and outcome in RC; the challenge of optimum care for 
elderly patients with comorbidities is best mastered at high-volume hospitals by 
high-volume surgeons. Preoperative patient information, patient selection, 
surgical techniques, and careful postoperative follow-up are the cornerstones to 
achieve good long-term results.

CONTEXT: New guidelines of the International Consultation on Urological Diseases 
for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) have recently been 
published.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive overview of the current role of radical 
cystectomy (RC) in MIBC.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A detailed Medline analysis was performed for original 
articles addressing the role of RC with regard to indication, timing, surgical 
extent, perioperative morbidity, oncologic outcome, and follow-up. The analysis 
also included radiation-based bladder-preserving strategies.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The major findings are presented in an evidence-based 
fashion and are based on large retrospective unicenter and multicenter series 
with some prospective data.
CONCLUSIONS: Open RC is the standard treatment for locoregional control of MIBC. 
Delay of RC is associated with reduced cancer-specific survival. In males, 
standard RC includes the removal of the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and 
distal ureters; in females, RC includes an anterior pelvic exenteration 
including the bladder, entire urethra and adjacent vagina, uterus, and distal 
ureters. A procedure sparing the urethra and the urethra-supplying autonomous 
nerves can be performed in case of a planned orthotopic neobladder. Further 
technical variations (ie, seminal-sparing or vaginal-sparing techniques) aimed 
at improving functional outcomes must be weighed against the risk of a positive 
margin. Laparoscopic surgery is promising, but long-term data are required prior 
to accepting it as an option equivalent to the open procedure. Lymphadenectomy 
should remove all lymphatic tissue around the common iliac, external iliac, 
internal iliac, and obturator region bilaterally. Complications after RC should 
be reported according to the modified Clavien grading system. In selected 
patients with MIBC, bladder-preserving therapy with cystectomy reserved for 
tumor recurrence represents a safe and effective alternative to immediate RC.

Feasibility of radical cystectomy in exclusive spinal and/or epidural 
anaesthesia.

PURPOSE: Muscle invasive bladder cancer can be found predominantly in elderly 
people with a high likelihood of suffering from concomitant diseases; especially 
in these patients, the risks associated with general anaesthesia during radical 
cystectomy can be the limiting factor of performing an otherwise indicated 
radical operation. To overcome this limitation, we analysed the feasibility of 
performing radical cystectomy in exclusive spinal and/or epidural anaesthesia.
METHODS: Between March and June 2010, nine patients underwent radical cystectomy 
in exclusive spinal and/or epidural anaesthesia. These patients were either not 
willing or unfit to undergo radical cystectomy in general anaesthesia. A 
continent urinary diversion (ileum neobladder) and an ileum-conduit were 
performed in five patients and four patients, respectively. The feasibility of 
radical cystectomy in regional anaesthesia was tested using a variety of 
parameters.
RESULTS: All nine procedures could be performed under strict regional 
anaesthesia. Mean operation time was 206 min (range 146-265 min), mean 
intraoperative blood loss was 622 ml (range 200-1,500 ml), mean postoperative 
time at intermediate care was 1 day (range 0-3 days) and mean length of hospital 
stay was 21.8 days (range 17-26 days). Analgesics of the WHO class I, II and III 
were applied for 5.7, 1.2 and 2.8 days mean, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Performance of radical cystectomy in exclusive spinal and/or 
epidural anaesthesia is feasible and can be considered particularly in those 
patients who would be otherwise unfit to undergo radical cystectomy in general 
anaesthesia. This new operative and anaesthesiological concept could also play 
an important role in new fast track regimens.

Primary localized bladder amyloidosis is a rare pathology that mimics urothelial 
cancer. Systemic disease and lymphoproliferative disorders should be excluded. 
Transurethral resection is the mainstay of treatment, although in cases of 
extensive bladder involvement or massive haematuria radical cystectomy has been 
reported. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first robot-assisted 
prostate-sparing simple cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladder and 
preservation of the seminal vesicles and vas deferens reported in the 
literature, in a patient with primary localized amyloidosis of the bladder.

Malignant melanoma in neo-bladder urinary cytology: a brief report.

Malignant melanoma has an unusual predilection for metastasis to the small 
bowel, sometimes several years after the original diagnosis. In patients who 
have had a cystoprostatectomy followed by an ileal conduit, metastatic melanoma 
to the ileal conduit can present in urine cytology. We present a rare case of 
metastatic malignant melanoma in neo-bladder urine in a patient who had 
undergone a cystoprostatectomy for high grade urothelial carcinoma of the 
bladder and prostatic adenocarcinoma of Gleason grade 3+3 and two excisional 
procedures for cutaneous malignant melanoma. He presented with persistent 
hematuria and urinary tract infections unresponsive to treatment. Urine cytology 
revealed single large atypical cells, with large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and 
cytoplasmic melanin pigment. Subsequent surgical resection revealed two areas of 
metastatic melanoma in the ileum, one of them being in the ileal conduit. The 
tumor cells were immunoreactive for S-100 protein, Melan-A, and HMB-45 and were 
negative for CAM5.2 and cytokeratins 7 and 20.

Hospital of Huzhou Teachers' College, Huzhou, P.R. China.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to introduce the surgical technique 
of a modified spiral orthotopic ileal neobladder and to assess the long-term 
outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and January 2006, 44 male and 7 
female patients with bladder cancer received radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic 
lymphadenectomy. An ileal segment 40 cm to 45 cm long was isolated to create a 
spiral orthotopic ileal neobladder, and the ureters were implanted into the 
reservoir using a non-refluxing split-cuff nipple technique. Preoperative, 
perioperative, and postoperative data were collected. Complications were 
classified as early (less than 3 months after surgery) or late (more than 3 
months after surgery). Continence incidence and urodynamic studies were 
evaluated 5 years after surgery. Duration of follow-up was an average of 95 
months (range 60-156 months).
RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. The mean operative time was 315 ± 
34 minutes. The mean blood loss was 783 ± 316 ml. There were 31 early 
complications in 21 patients (41%) and 42 late complications in 30 patients 
(59%). Urodynamic studies showed the maximum neobladder capacity to be 500 ± 71 
ml, maximum flow rate to be 16 ± 5 ml/s and post-voiding residual (PVR) to be 50 
± 44 ml. Postoperative continence was excellent with a daytime continence rate 
of 90% and a nocturnal continence rate of 78% 5 years after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified spiral neobladder is easy to perform and allows for 
excellent long-term results with regard to complications and continence.

Vaginal repair of neobladder-vaginal fistula: a case report and review of the 
literature.

Neobladder substitution after radical cystectomy for invasive cancer has become 
commonplace as it preserves normal volitional voiding through the native urethra 
and avoids urinary diversion. Neobladder-vaginal fistula (NVF) is a rare 
postoperative complication of this procedure that results in decreased quality 
of life. We describe a case of vaginal repair of a NVF and present a review of 
the literature.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical outcomes of sigmoid and ileal neobladders 
(NBs) created following radical cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 90 and 144 Japanese patients 
undergoing radical cystectomy and orthotopic NB reconstruction with a sigmoid 
and ileal segment, respectively. Postoperative clinical outcomes between the 
sigmoid and ileal NB groups (SNBG and INBG) were compared.
RESULTS: In this series, 110 early and 51 late complications occurred in 71 and 
41 patients, respectively; however, there was no significant difference in the 
incidence of complications between SNBG and INBG. At 1 year postoperatively, 
there were no significant differences in the proportion of spontaneous voiders 
and the continence status between these 2 groups; however, despite the lack of 
significant differences in the maximal flow rate and voided volume, the 
post-void residual in SNBG was significantly smaller than that in INBG. Voiding 
functional outcomes at 5 years postoperatively were also obtained from 28 and 49 
in SNBG and INBG, respectively. Although there were no significant changes in 
the functional outcomes in SNBG, the proportion of spontaneous voiders and 
post-void residual in INBG at 5 years postoperatively were significantly poorer 
than those at 1 year postoperatively. Furthermore, the postoperative 
health-related quality of life assessed by a Short-Form 36 survey did not show 
any significant differences in all 8 scores between these 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Both types of NB reconstruction resulted in comparatively 
satisfactory outcomes; however, the voiding function, particularly that on 
long-term follow-up, in SNBG appeared to be more favorable than that in INBG.

Although it is common to find metastases of transitional cell carcinoma of the 
bladder to the lymph nodes, lung, bone, and liver, cardiac metastases have only 
been rarely reported. We report a case of symptomatic metastasis of transitional 
cell cancer to the right ventricle. A 59-year-old man with a history of 
transitional cell bladder cancer status post cystectomy and chemotherapy, with 
neobladder placement, presented with hematuria, shortness of breath, murmur, and 
evidence of right-sided heart failure. On imaging workup, including 
transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography, we found a large 
right ventricular mass. A review of the literature showed that there are only 9 
cases of cardiac metastasis from transitional cell cancer reported; however, our 
case is unique because it is the only reported case of symptomatic improvement 
due to effective treatment with chemotherapy.
